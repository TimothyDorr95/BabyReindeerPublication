"Baby Reindeer | S1E01 | Episode Discussion 	1	Pawneewafflesarelife	I've only watched episode one, but as a woman who was stalked I didn't feel flattered or intrigued by the stalking, I was scared! I imagine it gets darker later, but I found it interesting - to me, it seems like there are so many red flags, but he seems mostly unconcerned or oblivious. Is it that women aren't scary? Or maybe I'm just on high alert? Episode one has me giving him the side-eye - he clearly enjoys SOME of the results of interacting with her and seems to be using her. In the comedy club, we see him make a calculated decision. There's a pause and a shift in expression and tone before he leans into mocking her to warm up the crowd and net himself a victory. She's hurt and shows it, but he knows she'll go along with it because of her obsession. Is the obsession ok, then, in his eyes if it's only somewhat manic? Would he feel fine continuing to lead her on and use her attention and emotional support if she was just ""normal"" crazy instead of stalker crazy? The final scene of the episode gave me chills - a guy at work who kept following me and cornering me in the stairwell/parking lot would send me that same song over work slack. It must be a creeper's anthem :P

I'm still only on episode 1, but my interpretation is that he can see she's a woman with serious mental problems, and he doesn't want to add to them by having her crush so utterly reject her. In her state she could be prone to suicide and while he doesn't want to be around her, he is not willing to be the thing that breaks her. So instead he's trying to let her down easy, remaining her friend but rebuffing any overt romantic gestures. However she constantly places him in social situations where the options are to reject her completely or become something more serious, and he keeps trying to defuse those situations with sexual jokes that just serve to encourage her further. The scene with the other bar patrons is a perfect example of this; they forced him into either accepting her as girlfriend or saying ""she's not my girlfriend, I'm just joking around"", which would absolutely devastate her psychologically, so he tried to escape with a joke that she took as a promise. Or the ""date"" they had. She wanted for them to go on a legitimate date, which he turned down. However she pushed by asking what friends do then, which again forced him into either going to get coffee together as friends, or saying ""I'm not your friend"", which once again would be emotionally devastating to her and not something that he is willing to inflict. My understanding is that he doesn't even want to be her friend at all, but how can you reject somebody who want to be your friend without being the bad guy hurting other's emotions for no reason? So he goes with her as a friend, but to her it's their first date. As somebody who hates confrontation and likes to make people happy I sympathise a lot with Gadd's character.

I think he understood how much he meant to her on an incredibly deep level in that moment and as you said, helped bring closure to understanding exactly why him.
