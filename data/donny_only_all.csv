It is def abusing/using someone to create a false identity on a dating profile while allowing your counterpart to be vulnerable and reveal their full identity (power differential right there). It is even worse to create a false identity and target a disadvantaged population that is already targeted by creeps and bigots (another power difference). His whole alter ego w/Teri - as he said in the show - was to make himself feel manly (again, being the manliest man and balancing power a thing). Power difference isn’t always inherently bad btw - some cis men prefer much shorter women. But the fact that Gadd specifically targeted trans women is akin to cis white men targeting Asian women (in the fetishizing way). There’s a reason they’re doing that and it’s the perceived power differential. He is clearly using Martha and gets off on her obsession (quite literally). He engages with her and eggs her on even though he wants nothing to do with her. She’s also using him and what she’s doing is inexcusable and a crime.

This episode touched on so many horrific and realistic details about sexual assault and rape and would of course trigger and make anyone uneasy. But that’s not a bad thing (in my opinion) we need more representation like this is the media, and to feel heard and seen especially male victims.

The story ends with him saying that he wants his son to know that he saved him - “because I always loved you more than I hated myself” (cue crying). The line in Baby Reindeer is the inverse of this, but I felt that it was similarly hopeful because of how cathartic it was - hopefully the first step in a long journey of healing.
