As someone who was r@ped under the influence I entirely understand the blame,the shame, the hyper sexuality afterwards, the violent thoughts, and even the porn addiction. This episode touched on so many horrific and realistic details about sexual assault and rape and would of course trigger and make anyone uneasy.
