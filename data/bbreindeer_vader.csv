"Baby Reindeer | S1E01 | Episode Discussion 	7	magneatos	I’m so sorry for my late reply! I tried answering you the day of and I thought my post had been sent but it never actually went through. I’m glad someone else answered you but this was my reply (luckily everything is my notes lol): According to Pete Walker, M.A., [“complex PTSD (C-PTSD) is often associated with a fourth possible response: the so-called fawn response. In other words, fawning is a trauma response where a person behaves in a people-pleasing way to avoid conflict and establish a sense of safety.”](https://www.charliehealth.com/post/is-fawning-a-trauma-response-what-you-need-to-know#) When faced with trauma, fawning serves as a coping mechanism. By developing a fawn trauma response, trauma survivors attempt to avoid conflict by pleasing their abuser. The fawn might agree with everything the abuser says, do things that will earn them approval, or set aside their personal feelings to avoid abuse. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/s/r3YlbqCjOR) Reddit post gave a great simplistic breakdown of how it manifests and functions. I’ve just started trauma therapy and realize that I have behaved similarly to Donny in how I’ve responded to some of the trauma that I’ve endured. I’ve always carried such shame and I’ve never seen a show so deeply explore that shame and the realities of cptsd. I just recently found more of Pete Walker’s work and I’ve never felt so seen. Just as I was delving into his theories about cptsd (depending on your trauma response or hybrid type, people with cptsd can struggle with symptoms of narcissism (fight), symptoms of ocd (flight) symptoms of adhd (freeze) and codependency (fawn). I was clearly able to see that I rarely use fight and for one, it’s because flight/freeze/fawn is what helped me survive my traumas both emotionally and physically (in terms of my safety). In most of my traumas and even Donny’s case, fighting could have resulted in more violence (or death but the latter probably wasn’t going to be the case the with disgusting groomer out of fear of getting caught but who knows), particularly during sexual assault and/or rape. Just as I was exploring these trauma responses in terms of my own trauma, I began watching Baby Reindeer. This allowed for a unique experience, letting me really see the show shine at depicting these trauma responses. This has been such an excellent show for a variety of reasons but it truly delves deep into the mind of someone with long sustained trauma (like cptsd) and the shame that comes with it along with not trusting yourself and/or your body, over empathizing/lack of boundaries, freezing during moments of violence and in turn, not understanding why and the cycle of shame repeats, and the list could go on and on! Tldr: The fawn response [“emerges as a defense mechanism in individuals who have endured considerable trauma or abuse, manifesting as an overriding urge to placate and conform to others’ wishes to avoid confrontation. This behavior is not just an avoidance strategy but a deeply entrenched survival technique, often observed in those with a history of traumatic experiences.”](https://bayareacbtcenter.com/understanding-the-fawn-response-to-trauma/) *the link above actually provides a lot of good breakdowns (despite being CBT based therapy) about difficulties setting boundaries, people pleasing tendencies, emotional suppression, low self esteem, fear of abandonment, etc.

"Baby Reindeer | S1E01 | Episode Discussion 	0	dearitsquinoa	This entire episode is hilariously meta - Richard Gadd puts himself on display as a failing comedian/bartender in his late 20s who is targeted by a similarly dead-end situated older woman. The relationship hinges on them each using each other to fuel their egos. From the script, Martha seems to have targeted him because he seemed weak and disappointed in himself. Likewise she is clearly weak and I would imagine disappointed in herself (if actually true depiction, her messy apartment is an easy depression/dysregulated nervous system marker). Martha attempts to capitalize on Gadd's weakness in terrifying fashion but ultimately, Richard gains the upper hand - he uses her to feel better about himself (a female stalker is concerning, but flattering), he uses her to enhance his failing comedy and likely profits from this. We all ultimately engage with this Netflix show written and sold to Netflix by Richard, giving him economic gain and an ego boost, about how he used his stalker for economic gain and an ego boost. This phenomenon is a work of art and I'm shocked no one has described it that way yet.

"Baby Reindeer | S1E01 | Episode Discussion 	1	Pawneewafflesarelife	I've only watched episode one, but as a woman who was stalked I didn't feel flattered or intrigued by the stalking, I was scared! I imagine it gets darker later, but I found it interesting - to me, it seems like there are so many red flags, but he seems mostly unconcerned or oblivious. Is it that women aren't scary? Or maybe I'm just on high alert? Episode one has me giving him the side-eye - he clearly enjoys SOME of the results of interacting with her and seems to be using her. In the comedy club, we see him make a calculated decision. There's a pause and a shift in expression and tone before he leans into mocking her to warm up the crowd and net himself a victory. She's hurt and shows it, but he knows she'll go along with it because of her obsession. Is the obsession ok, then, in his eyes if it's only somewhat manic? Would he feel fine continuing to lead her on and use her attention and emotional support if she was just ""normal"" crazy instead of stalker crazy? The final scene of the episode gave me chills - a guy at work who kept following me and cornering me in the stairwell/parking lot would send me that same song over work slack. It must be a creeper's anthem :P

"Baby Reindeer | S1E01 | Episode Discussion 	2	Potatosmom94	Yeah I feel like all the woman I’ve seen who experienced stalking with very frightened by the experience. I don’t think any of them ever felt flattered, curious, intrigued, or interested. It happened to a roommate who lived with me. He started showing up at her work. She had to coordinate with her boyfriend, roommates, and coworkers to have someone with her to walk her to her car and go with her certain places she was likely to show up. The weirdest part was the guy stalking her had a girlfriend the whole time (she actually met him by being casual friends with the gf originally). He got his gf to message her for him, inviting her to a threesome etc. She first shut them down, then refused to engage & blocked them. At least one report to the police but luckily it did stop eventually (or honestly we may have just all moved it was a long time ago). My younger sister also had a stalker. She was working at Walmart maybe like 19/20 years old max. A customer at least in his 30s-40s took an interest in her. He started to show up on a lot of her shifts, would wait for her in the parking lot, would leave gifts and notes on her car. When she spoke to her manager to see if she could change her shift and get someone to walk her to/from her car they asked her what she was doing to cause the guy to be interested/egg him on. So my sister quit and never went back to the job. Thankfully he never knew where she lived or got ahold of any of her contact information. I had an abusive ex who I blocked on all my social media/phone. We had an order to keep him from coming by my house too. But when he wasn’t able to get ahold of me he texted my littlest sister (different sister than the one who stalked) because he had her number from when she used to babysit for his daughter for us. She immediately blocked him. However, when she told me he had messaged her I had a straight up panic attack while boarding a plane and had to be temporarily deplaned and was only allowed to board again once I had calmed down enough that I wasn’t freaking out the other passengers. I think as a woman it doesn’t typically feel flattering because there is always the ever looming fear and threat of harm. The knowledge of what could potentially happen always present in our minds. Whereas typically women, especially white women, are conditioned to be viewed as non threatening, emotional but not inherently violent, something to be pitied, annoyed, or alarmed by but seldom feared. I can also say from experience that while you do see both genders keep people of the opposite sex in their lives only for an ego boost, the way it happens with men tends to be pretty patterned and looks a lot like how this first episode is playing out. Though most would have opted out as soon as the emails sent and especially at the diner. I had one male friend who I considered myself fairly close to. We sort of had a fwb situation but mainly we would just hang out. I’d watch his dog, he’d help me with putting up shelves, we’d go to the bars. I got him contacting jobs by recommending him to my landlord/roommate who he told that as I was one of his closest friends and how much he appreciated me. However, at his birthday party I had a chance to talk to some of his male friends I had met a handful of times. I was informed that he had told them I was annoying, always messaging him, wouldn’t leave him alone, showing up uninvited, etc. I did not meet the “aesthetic” of the kind of girl he wanted to be associated with so it was easier for him to lie to his friends rather than own an actual friendship with me. They learned the truth pretty easily but it definitely changed how I engaged with the friend. The scene in the bar with his embarrassment at his friends seeing him engage with her really hit home for me because I’ve seen that play out in real life so many times.

I think the last scene where Donny is thinking of deleting the FB friend request, he looks back at his mink hat and comedian props and then decides to accept her friend request - that to me means he knows its bad but it could somehow enhance his comedian career (either with Martha as the audience to fuel his ego, or edging the audience along as she did in this episode, or as material for his comedy jokes (or future netflix material)). Donny's not naive, just awkwardly nice but opportunistic. In any case, Martha poses no life threatening threat to him (so far), as a woman, so there's not much reason why Donny would not take her up as a presence in his life.

I'm still only on episode 1, but my interpretation is that he can see she's a woman with serious mental problems, and he doesn't want to add to them by having her crush so utterly reject her. In her state she could be prone to suicide and while he doesn't want to be around her, he is not willing to be the thing that breaks her. So instead he's trying to let her down easy, remaining her friend but rebuffing any overt romantic gestures. However she constantly places him in social situations where the options are to reject her completely or become something more serious, and he keeps trying to defuse those situations with sexual jokes that just serve to encourage her further. The scene with the other bar patrons is a perfect example of this; they forced him into either accepting her as girlfriend or saying ""she's not my girlfriend, I'm just joking around"", which would absolutely devastate her psychologically, so he tried to escape with a joke that she took as a promise. Or the ""date"" they had. She wanted for them to go on a legitimate date, which he turned down. However she pushed by asking what friends do then, which again forced him into either going to get coffee together as friends, or saying ""I'm not your friend"", which once again would be emotionally devastating to her and not something that he is willing to inflict. My understanding is that he doesn't even want to be her friend at all, but how can you reject somebody who want to be your friend without being the bad guy hurting other's emotions for no reason? So he goes with her as a friend, but to her it's their first date. As somebody who hates confrontation and likes to make people happy I sympathise a lot with Gadd's character.

He clearly likes the way she sees him and makes him feel about herself. He just doesn’t like her. The mixed signals are insane and she’s clearly not right in the head.

He knows these people's biggest secret (they're outing themselves as being trans) but shields any weakness of his own by hiding his real name and listing a fake job. Then he ""falls in love"" with the power imbalance that a trans woman gives him (as a cis male who seems to believe that he underperforms his cis male social status) in the fake identity and world he created from himself. The moment he's sober he humiliates this trans woman by running away from her after who knows how many dates. How is no one noticing how insufferable this behavior is.

Either immigrants or they have non white ancestry, like the moors. Sicilians are often not white, Greek people are often not white.

"Baby Reindeer | S1E03 | Episode Discussion 	9	NoWorkingDaw	“Race is physical and genetic attribute” Thanks for proving them right. “That’s not how race works! It’s about physical and genetic attributes” French, Italians, Spaniards, all physically look the same to each other. They also share a lot of genetic attributes. And surprise, they are white. Yes some aren’t “white” but the only ones who wouldn’t be, would be those who are mixed/biracial it’s due to any racial admixture like with all races, however that doesn’t mean majority of Spaniards and Italians don’t look physically, white, especially when they are monoracial/have little to no racial admixture going on in their ancestry. Also, you’re acting as if having 5% of a different race in your blood makes you not look whatever race you look like. Because, as you said, race is not only genetics, it’s also, and mostly phenotypical. I’d even say that race in the modern day is purely physical as well. Because we cannot see the genetic percentages of a person. So going by that, Italians, and Spaniards etc are white. This isn’t to say that an Italian can’t be another race, because, at the end of the day, terms like “Italian”” denote nationality. But the majority of them are white. They in fact do share a lot of said “genetic atttibutes” (European/caucasian) like with white Americans, Europeans etc more in common with each other than say, a black or Asian person which is exactly why they look white and not any other race. As for greeks, y’all love to choose when they are, and aren’t white. And quite frankly, they look white too.

You can be deluded if you want but at the end of the day, they are male. Therefore, it would be a gay relationship. Because their sex is the same. Y’all preached that sex and gender were different so it doesn’t matter who presents as what. Because sex is defined pretty simply, and not by looks. Right? Again, are trans people suddenly not part of the LGBT+ group anymore? Furthermore, what you look like doesn’t change what you are. There’s feminine men and masculine women that don’t present as their respective sex’s stereotypical presentation/standard however that doesn’t change what they are in their biology. If you were born a male how the fuck can you be a subset of females? If I were to bleach my skin and changed my hair to match that of a white person, am I now a type of white person? Even though my genetics would say otherwise? Also, how can you speak on what all gay men are attracted to considering the popularity of femboys and the like? lol. Ain’t shit different but a boob job and a bit of mental illness. So ALL gay men only like masculine men now? Someone please tell the femboys they and their male partners are cancelled and aren’t gay. You’re trying to tell me that, gay men would be attracted to females in men’s clothing? Since when did gay men like vagina? To be gay means absolutely nothing now. Apparently. There’s men who literally like tomboys and women with tons of muscle. Does that make them gay? I’m curious

Maybe he was actually incapable of getting a job to pay rent, but it appears to be his choice. Anyway, his own parents didn’t appear to be financially support him or his ex.

It is def abusing/using someone to create a false identity on a dating profile while allowing your counterpart to be vulnerable and reveal their full identity (power differential right there). It is even worse to create a false identity and target a disadvantaged population that is already targeted by creeps and bigots (another power difference). His whole alter ego w/Teri - as he said in the show - was to make himself feel manly (again, being the manliest man and balancing power a thing). Power difference isn’t always inherently bad btw - some cis men prefer much shorter women. But the fact that Gadd specifically targeted trans women is akin to cis white men targeting Asian women (in the fetishizing way). There’s a reason they’re doing that and it’s the perceived power differential. He is clearly using Martha and gets off on her obsession (quite literally). He engages with her and eggs her on even though he wants nothing to do with her. She’s also using him and what she’s doing is inexcusable and a crime. But Teri noted verbatim in the show: Gadd likes the attention from Martha. That’s why he continues to engage instead of appropriately cutting her off.

I identify as male, so therefore, I am a man. I'm not half a man because I wasn't born with a penis. And if I date a woman, I'm in a straight relationship. He >!happens to identify as bisexual. But that's because of his attraction to men. Martha is a woman, so it has nothing to do with her. He could still be straight and be into Martha.!< Hopefully you're not taking the mick, but it's hard to tell these days.

" Baby Reindeer | S1E04 | Episode Discussion 	1	wiklr	It's a good depiction on how abuse gets rationalized in someone's head. Donny invited Darrien into his life, while he rejected Martha. The latter was easier to talk about to other people. Also Donny is a male victim and assaulted by a gay man and a woman. He doesn't have the framework where girls are raised to fear predators. Likely much harder to process for him and why he sought the company of misogynistic straight guys to ingratiate himself back to feeling ""normal."" He also tried to scrub the SA by creating new situations he consented to, but it's not a healthy coping mechanism in the end. Him passively entertaining Martha, not knowing how to say no, set boundaries - all very relatable aspects of being hounded by unwanted attention. But at the same time ""she saw me the way I wanted to be seen"" is also accurate. Most people like to feel loved, wanted, be seen as both attractive and funny - even in such a twisted obsessive way. And for the most part, it doesn't look dangerous so it's tolerated. It was fine until it wasn't.

",1,wiklr,"It's a good depiction on how abuse gets rationalized in someone's head. Donny invited Darrien into his life, while he rejected Martha. The latter was easier to talk about to other people. Also Donny is a male victim and assaulted by a gay man and a woman. He doesn't have the framework where girls are raised to fear predators. Likely much harder to process for him and why he sought the company of misogynistic straight guys to ingratiate himself back to feeling ""normal.""

Now I realise with how Darrien would instantly drop Donny and then ring him out of the blue, expecting him to drop everything to come over… without a care in the world for his personal responsibilities or obligations to his acting classes… I was immediately reminded of how ex-partners and ex-friends would often use me in this similar manner, to get what they want, be it validation, emotional support, sex, alcohol, etc… Wow… just wow.

The story ends with him saying that he wants his son to know that he saved him - “because I always loved you more than I hated myself” (cue crying). The line in Baby Reindeer is the inverse of this, but I felt that it was similarly hopeful because of how cathartic it was - hopefully the first step in a long journey of healing.

It’s been a while since I so deeply resonated with something so haunting, so relatable.

"Baby Reindeer | S1E06 | Episode Discussion 	0	Fit_Advertising5947	Literally so hard to watch but leaves you sitting thinking…. Everyone can relate to aspects of almost every character portrayed in this, just as Donnie (Richard Gadd) finds himself finding more in common with his stalker as the story unfolds……. Then when his ex walks in and sees all the emails on the wall, the look she gives says it……… Honestly, this show was probably the best work of art I’ve seen in a long time. It surpasses the whale, even 😢 I literally bawled when he gave his confession on stage. After suffering abuse of my own, I believe it does affect a person in exactly the manner he says… “We’re like an open wound, left out for all of life’s weirdos to sniff at….” And really, it does open this gate for a life long path of people who can sense that vulnerability in you. I believe even people who aren’t predators, just normal people…. Can smell that vulnerability, and can sense that you are weak. It’s crazy. Just that whole speech… so many things resonated from that for me. When he says, “I loved one thing more than her (Teri), you know what that was? Hating myself….” And that was his reason for losing her, I just broke. My boyfriend and I currently have been together almost a year, and we struggle as any couple does at times….. but this was so huge to me. I have very deep rooted insecurities - as most people do. I’m a highly emotional person, and coupled with these insecurities I do find myself hating myself or feeling like an utter failure almost every day. At work, with my family, at home, even the simplest things sometimes like not being able to do something small such as clean up after myself or saying the wrong things…. That can come like a wrecking ball and destroy any other positive growth I have made. Not being able to afford to get groceries. Being unable to get along with people. Not being as present in my children’s life. Not being able to make people happy. It’s like I just can’t get ahead, so much like Richard Gadd in this story……. It was not only emotional draining and heartbreaking, but it opened my eyes to things that I can change in my own life. Things that I have repressed or maybe overlooked as trauma that I thought didn’t affect me… his bravery to go to the world with his admissions of abuse, and his ability to find sympathy for Martha realizing she’s mentally ill… have made me rethink so many things. Just the fact that he goes out after and admits that she - Martha (his stalker) was a victim in all this, not a culprit, is self awareness at its absolute highest level. I know this post is all over the place, every time I think about any aspect of the show it blows my mind. I just feel like anyone and everyone, struggling or not, should watch this. It is worth it. From episode one, I always thought maybe Martha called him baby reindeer because he almost did have this look of hurt in his eyes, like a sad baby reindeer. I loved how she brought him to the point of admission… she knew he had been hurt. She was a vital part in getting him to open up, to look outside himself for answers within himself. Fuck I just can’t 😱🤯😭 best show. Hands down, Richard Gadd totally nailed it, and the fact that he went through these things and had the courage to do this is bold, beautiful, amazing, and extremely special. I never thought I’d watch a dark comedy mini series on Netflix about a man with a crazy stalker, that could open up my mind and help me understand so much of my own past and my feelings and how I can change that, and inspire me to learn to at least like myself for now, to save my own life and relationship….. thank you Richard Gadd. Brilliant. ❤️

"Baby Reindeer | S1E07 | Episode Discussion 	5	sarahelizam	That moment was set up so perfectly, because his dad’s expression prior can easily be misread as disapproval or disappointment when he’s actually stealing himself and finding the words to say. It’s emblematic of something I’ve really noticed about how many men (especially more traditionally masculine men or those from conservative backgrounds) engage with and express really heavy emotions. This is something I feel I’ve learned about as I’ve come out as transmasc and gotten a better understanding of how socialization impacts all of us. I’ve mostly been friends with and had positive relationships with men most of my life, but even though from a young age I knew I didn’t fit in with girls I also wasn’t raised as a boy (though to my parents credit they did the chill 90s parenting of not overly gendering me which I can’t help but appreciate lol). Now that am often not seem as a woman, at least by the people I spend time with I’ve been able to understand where I’ve identified with the guys in my life and where I had incomplete pictures (generalized or individualized). Even today with the men around me being mostly some kind of queer leftist and pretty emotionally forthcoming, I’ve seen a lot of the struggles with opening up, and also some of the strengths of the type of support men offer each other that I think get downplayed. Guys tend to be very piecemeal when it comes to sharing vulnerable things, especially if the thing is too much to easily make a sort of joke at. Which is imo also a valid way to approach something that is deeply uncomfortable, especially when first coming to terms with it but also when you need to share something that you’ve processed but will upset others - making a joke at your expense can be a way to have some sort of control over the situation or a way to do emotional labor for the listener (“see I can joke about it, please don’t make this a bigger deal than it has to be.”) We all want to be have some control in our narratives and I think these are not bad ways of doing that, though they are often seen (imo unfairly) as emotionally stunted by women who are used to different ways of sharing hardship. I think (and feel, from my own experiences) that women tend to want this type of disclosure to be done in a much more emotionally open and painfully sincere way. But it often feels that’s more for the listener’s benefit than for the person sharing. I’ve always had an easier type opening up about this stuff with guy friends where I can be irreverent about my trauma instead if the almost suffocatingly, sickly sweet support the women I’ve opened up to try to offer. Not to say there is a wrong way, or that what works for people falls entirely on gendered lines. But I think sometimes we unfairly say some of the ways men do open up are emotionally stunted not realizing that the flippancy or the limited pieces of information might not just be for their sakes, but for the listener’s as well. I think a lot of emotional labor that men are taught to do is not recognized as such and it will take time to build a better social understanding of it, just like it’s taken time to develop language around the types of emotional labor women tend to do. I think that’s one of the things I like about being nonbinary and not neatly fitting into a gendered box. There is so much miscommunication and misunderstanding in these gendered wars we have going on. I think it’s nice to appreciate the different ways we all try, and how often what we try and what we’re struggling against is so much more similar than most would have us believe. Tangent aside, I was in a very similar situation as this with my dad once. I had recently been assaulted (not sexually, but very violently) by a transphobic person while my ex stood by and kept my phone from me the whole time. Months later, once I was out of that abusive relationship with my ex I started sharing the most essential bits of what had happened to me during that period, including that incident. I think I just used “attack” and told my dad that he shouted “I’ll kill you tr*nny” the whole time, but my dad thought I meant I’d been sexually assaulted. And he told me immediately it didn’t change anything about me or my worth, that he’d been raped and was always there to talk. I thanked him for telling me and told him I loved him, but immediately made sure he didn’t worry that I’d been raped (honestly I was telling him about enough traumatic stuff, I really didn’t want to add more things to worry about me for). Neither of us have brought it up again, and I think it’s an area where I wouldn’t want him to be ambushed into explaining his trauma to his kid. He’s very much the traditional midwestern version of Donny’s dad here. There was something very raw about that scene for me on that front alone. Seeing that implacable father figure, someone you grow up kind of believing is invincible as a kid, being so honest in so few words. Even with my dad coming out and saying it flat out it took me a moment to process. It hadn’t with my male friend’s who’d been sexually assaulted and had confided in me (which the older I get the more I realize most of the men in my life have been seriously sexually assaulted, about half by women which comes with it’s own whole new set of hurdles for survivors), but something about the way dad’s are almost mythologized (especially ones who conform to rather traditional masculinity) makes it that much more of a gut punch. Especially when you come into the situation preparing to be vulnerable about your own trauma with a person who is (at least socially) viewed as a protector, only to abruptly face that they too have been harmed. Like a final shattering of that childlike image we have of our parents through which we can see them more equally as people, just as vulnerable and resilient as we are. Apologies for the length lol, this scene just really moved me so of course I had to go on reddit to write about it, as one does 🤷🏻

"Baby Reindeer | S1E07 | Episode Discussion 	0	stassiebabby	I thought it was so interesting that the show ended just how it started… like the similarities between Martha & Donny. The final scene is Donny walking into that bar, alone and sad, ordering a drink, not having his wallet, and the bartending giving it to him for free, likely because he pitied him. This is the exact same situation as how he met Martha- she came into the bar, sad and alone, he pitied her and gave her the free drink. It almost makes me think that Donny is now going to be obsessed with the nice bartender who gave him the free drink? I don’t really think that’s what happened next, but I do think he realized the similarities between himself then and there and the situation of how he first met Martha. I also thought it was interesting this lasted for about 3 years- 2014-2017 wasn’t it? It really puts it into perspective why he almost/ did ‘miss’ her, because she became so involved in his life, whether he liked it or not, he got so used to it. Overall, I really loved the series! Very great acting and thought provoking. So crazy and sad it’s based on a true story.

But like...he knows that about her. He read everything about her online....and he still dove right in. Like who does that? Whether it was actually because he wanted to use a crazy person to get stories for his comedy career, or maybe wanted to use her for attention, or maybe he was using her for something else I don’t know… but it's kind of fucked up to do that to someone. And he had plenty of opportunities to step away or stop her, but he never quite sets a boundary until things have gone way too far. Early on he could have prevented her from hanging out in the bar by not allowing her to sit for free. Could have told her name to the police much earlier on than he did. He could have not given the crazy stalker lady his email. He could have not spied on her and a number of other things where he just kept sort of...letting her stalk him? And then the whole thing about him getting drugged and raped, and it looked like a pretty traumatic experience, but then goes back for more. He calls it ""grooming"" in his comedy monologue near the end, but I honestly don’t know what to make of all that. His explanation feels dishonest to me because I don't know if you can call it ""grooming"" when both people are trying to use each other for something. And then he listened to thousands of his stalker's voicemails. He basically turned into a maniac who began obsessing/fantasizing over the person who played a role in ruining his relationship with someone he loved ...another thing i don't even know where to begin with. And at least her craziness appears to be the result of trauma, which sort of makes sense. He gives his monologue at the comedy show near the end to explain why he does the things he does..and it’s because he wants fame and hates himself. Something just feels off like there's way more too it than that. And the whole story is from his point of view. I just get the sense he's an unreliable narrator and he's leaving a ton of shit out. This is definitely one of those situations where there's two sides to every story. Granted in this case the story is fascinating cause she's crazy and he's batshit insane.

He could have not given the crazy stalker lady his email. He could have not spied on her and a number of other things where he just kept sort of...letting her stalk him? And then the whole thing about him getting drugged and raped, and it looked like a pretty traumatic experience, but then goes back for more. He calls it ""grooming"" in his comedy monologue near the end, but I honestly don’t know what to make of all that. His explanation feels dishonest to me because I don't know if you can call it ""grooming"" when both people are trying to use each other for something. And then he listened to thousands of his stalker's voicemails. He basically turned into a maniac who began obsessing/fantasizing over the person who played a role in ruining his relationship with someone he loved ...another thing i don't even know where to begin with. And at least her craziness appears to be the result of trauma, which sort of makes sense. He gives his monologue at the comedy show near the end to explain why he does the things he does..and it’s because he wants fame and hates himself. Something just feels off like there's way more too it than that. And the whole story is from his point of view. I just get the sense he's an unreliable narrator and he's leaving a ton of shit out. This is definitely one of those situations where there's two sides to every story. Granted in this case the story is fascinating cause she's crazy and he's batshit insane.	
",2,illogicalone,"Yeah I don't really know how to put it. It is hard to top all the crazy stuff she does. She lies about being a lawyer and then obsessively stalks someone and leaves thousands of voicemails and all the other stuff she did. She's definitely on the deep end of crazy. But like...he knows that about her. He read everything about her online....and he still dove right in. Like who does that? Whether it was actually because he wanted to use a crazy person to get stories for his comedy career, or maybe wanted to use her for attention, or maybe he was using her for something else I don’t know… but it's kind of fucked up to do that to someone.

Nothing but respect for Richard Gadd for sharing his story to the world, takes great courage to do that, I can’t imagine how hard it was for him to put himself through that again. The finale was well done, I was tearing up watching that last scene.

I couldn’t stop watching this though, and thinking about it for days after. I hated it to start with, thought it was too jovial and almost a like cheesy comedy. Though there was something keeping me to continue. Man, I was so wrong. It’s so cleverly put together, it made me howl with laughter and shed a tear on two occasions. One of the most remarkable, intriguing weird yet awesome things I’ve ever watched.
