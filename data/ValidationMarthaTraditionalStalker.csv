924,"She adored and worshipped him in a sick way, and he needed that then.",0,99
252,"Holy heck this is creepy. I understand there’s something else going on and I also know he feels sorry for her but so far he’s also frustrating the hell out of me. This woman needs help, not to be egged on.",1,99
233,Why didn't he ask her why she can't afford anything after all that bragging? It's bothering me.,0,99
213,Yeah I can't believe that she was fully already a convicted stalker and he kept on with it! In interviews about the show he's said that she needs mental help but also maybe he does.,0,1
344,"Given the fact that this crazy stalker lady insulted Asian people in a previous episode, I wouldn't be surprised if she were being racist against Teri, though I initially took it as her insulting Americans as a whole. I'm certain that a racial element is at play here.",0,1
894,"What creeps me out the most is that everything else was horrendously misspelled. Except those ""Sent from my iPhone"" tags--until later. She INTENTIONALLY misspelled the other words, and I have no idea why, but it's terrifying that she was controlling her perception to that extent.",0,0
222,Man he is leading her on HARD it’s aggravating,0,99
114,I’m intrigued by it but don’t understand how she could have been a graduate lawyer if she can barely spell. I’m hoping more is revealed which explains this as it’s a bit distracting.,0,0
1026,I was wondering why his dad didn't just block her number as well,0,1
842,Needing therapy and being courageous enough to be honest can go hand in hand. I don’t see how this was a judgmental comment. He needs it AND she needs it.,0,99
927,I thought he actually had sex with her?,99,99
454,"rhey are LITERALLY saying the opposite of be quiet. He needed to tell the police, Teri the truth, and Liz. He put them all in danger by being a coward and straight up antagonixing her. Instead his ""empathetic"" feelings are making his stupid decisions. Like why go back out and talk to her and invite her in your hom?. That is begging for the drama Keely was talking about",0,99
182,"Yes, but as the policeman explains to him, it's different because there is a difference in physical capabilities to do harm. Also, he isn't discouraging her or explaining to her any of her misinterpretations. He just encourages it more.",0,99
437,"my initial thought was she’s just fixating on something she thinks is insulting in the moment, tho wearing boots is pretty tame in comparison to everything else she had said. sooo disregard this if we find out more about that in the next episodes 😄",0,99
971,Yeah I didn't buy it either. She was really obviously unhinged in that bit.,0,99
1168,"This show made me understand myself in ways no therapy was ever able to do. The last scene, I think he not only realized they were the same, but that he had become her safe place and she had become his....in the most toxic way possible. Trauma changes people and those that haven't experienced can never understand.",1,99
367,"I find it fascinating that this is how the ex-gf phrased it (a distanced, non-loving way of explaining his situation) when the show is a literal display of all of the actual reasons he kept her around. Loving the drama and 'having nothing in your life to focus on except that drama' or being drawn to that because the rest of your life is scary and/or monotonous? The dude was in the process of coming out in this late 20's, nobody gets out of that unscathed. It's just so funny to me that this show works HARD to explain that he doesn't love the drama as much as he needs and escapes through it, but sure we'll go with the easy summary.",0,99
257,I feel worse for him than I do the stalker,0,99
1169,"incredibly moving and brave story that final scene hit me like a ton of bricks. My abuser had a similar thing - a pet name given to me (albeit at the time I 'loved it' - eg the affection she'd show between hating and tearing me apart) that was equally a result of being seen as this 'saviour' or pure goodness from her own trauma. I remember reading years ago about this, how someone prone to such illness creates you as this perfect image and saviour in their brain, their inner child needing safety from their trauma earlier in their life and when you aren't that, in whatever form that may be, they hate you for it. To them you are both their only saviour and their source of pain, and only you can solve it. Bit of a tangent as I reflect on the illness my abuser suffered with, but man just kudos on this show. I was in floods of tears the last 2 episodes or so.",1,99
893,"I think her obsession and off-putting consistency (hundreds of messages in a day, all with the same Sent From iPhone message at the bottom. Around 41,000 emails in just a 2 year period..) with such a minuscule detail really illustrates the extent of her insecurity and self-loathing. She is self-conscious about everything. Even the type of phone she has. Those are things people don’t worry about unless they’ve way too much time to dwell, compare, and contrast the difference between their sad life and other people’s less sad lives that they’d quite literally kill to obtain. She just didn’t want to let go of the persona even through the many inconsistencies. I think continuing to pretend gave her peace of mind, more peace of mind than embracing her true self/life. But maybe she just wasn’t aware that Donny knew she didn’t have an iPhone? I think that might be plausible, but I don’t remember many details from the show, just that and all the burner phones in the drawer.",1,1
203,"My thought exactly. He should have got away after her first crazy reaction at the cafeteria, instead he gave her complete access to his past life accepting her friend request! Also why he doesn't block her email address? I don't get it...maybe he's just too good and he can't say no to people but still...",0,1
962,"Yes that was insane! Why was he seemingly siding with the clearly mentally unwell woman, and actually googling and goading him?! I was (momentarily) so elated when he finally told the guy to google her shit instead!",0,1
943,"Donny literally mentioned it in the first episode. And in the episode where he went to her apartment, she was using a laptop to write emails. This is the same woman who claimed to be a lawyer. It’s a delusion.",0,99
1006,She doesn’t have an iPhone which Donny said in episode 1 and there’s been multiple typos of iPhone (since she’s the one manually typing it). Every time one of her emails pops up I laugh at the new way she can rearrange the letters 😂,0,0
1011,What’s her twitter?,99,99
125,She could’ve graduated before she completely lost it,0,99
217,This was so painful to watch. I don't want to victim blame but this man is enabling her... She's shown time and time again how unwell she is and he's just playing along? I'm dumbfounded.,1,99
447,"Because she would hide everytime the mom came out, it shows her doin this",0,1
278,That was so hard to watch. He is just encouraging her. But the bosses making a joke od it is so uncomfortably realistic as other men don't take male victims of women seriously.,0,99
1195,This show is crazyyyy i thought it was gonna be just a banter UK show but omg what a wild ride ! So raw so real it’s covered so many topics I don’t even know where to start. This hit home for me so much personally because of the grooming and abuse of power especially in the entertainment industry . The fact that the stalker wasn’t even the main plot of this story .. this is one of the best shows i’ve watched in a. long time!This is a proper limited series. The fact that it’s a real story just boggles my brain. It made me feel like i need to be in therapy for a lot of things in my life too😂😭,0,99
216,"In real life the actress Jessica Gunning is actually cute. Yes she is overweight which hinders her appearance for sure but in real life, she has dark hair and it doesn’t look like a Brillo pad lol and she dresses cute. Looks 10 years younger than her character",0,99
321,"I couldn’t believe it, I practically shouted at the TV for someone to call the police! You finally have her on actual assault, use it!!",0,1
942,Was it? I just assumed she has two phones lol (she has a lot of phones in her kitchen drawer),0,99
363,I just finished this episode and I’m literally scared I’m going to have nightmares of her,0,99
178,"Yess this is exactly what I came on here to find, based on episode 1 it’s clear they’re both benefiting from this relationship. She’s displayed she’s clearly batshit crazy but he’s willingly choosing to engage further. Definitely seems like he’s a man who’s unhappy with his circumstances, disappointed by his career and love life enjoying the attention this person is bringing to his life. To then produce and act in a film about the experience is the ultimate conclusion to the value and purpose this stalker brought to his life.",0,1
1130,"Beautifully put, I agree with you. I also think that him discovering the origin of his (main) nickname was similar to when you search up what your own name origin means in Latin or Greek or elsewhere, like, this *is* me this is was named after/who I *am* ( to this person). I think he understood how much he meant to her on an incredibly deep level in that moment and as you said, helped bring closure to understanding exactly why him. I feel he represented the same safety and love away from the pain as the teddy reindeer... and that's what her voicemails gave him in return. Ironically his nickname from his mum is bear, which might back up the teddy bear thing too. I'm bowled over by this series.",0,0
1030,"When he told her that she has to stop or they won’t be able to be together… I‘ve lost it, I had to pause it out of rage. DONNY WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING IT Edit: Okay. There was actually some sanity behind it, I‘m glad.",0,99

1190,What’s her ig?,99,99
124,"Its just her stream of consciousness,her thoughts are going so fast in her head that her fingers cant keep up. You can also notice when shes talking to Donny she talks super fast,in that manic state.",0,99
131,It's not a plot hole. She is not in her right mind when typing this out. I had a friend who'd start typing like that when she was frantic/manic. Otherwise her spelling was completely normal.,0,0
947,">You really getting worked up about this, huh? Nice projecting. >Never did I claim that she does have to have one, i just said it isnt impossible. Nice job backtracking lol. Your original comments said ""I just assumed she has two phones lol "" ""Doesn't mean that she can't have one at home."" which means you're still giving her the benefit of the doubt that she still secretly owns the phone lol >""Good Job"" as if you didn't miss the way more important fact that she is actually a lawyer, which was also mentioned in the police reports Donny read about her. But yes dude, keep ranting about what phones she doesn't have. She had a law degree, I agree. That was painfully obvious from the fridge, I agree. That wasn't really a subtle detail to be proud of. That doesn't mean she is **currently** a lawyer. But yes, keep moving the goal post and ignore the fact that you started this with the ""I just assumed she has two phones lol"" comment.",0,0
141,It’s creepy coming out of her mouth. But out of a genuine lover’s mouth it can feel very heartfelt. https://youtu.be/b7GhrUaNDAI?si=BoFlA1SxFKdTxQpk Like this song.,0,99
952,"She may or may not have one, but we have seen many many typos throughout the entire show, which lets us assume that majority of the time she isn't using an iPhone.",0,0
1230,how is he crazier than her,0,99
192,Even from the picnic thing in the bar you can see how someone might think that he was interested in her. Also he quickly sees that she is very possessive and that doesn't rise any flags.,0,99
875,"What creeps me out the most is that everything else was horrendously misspelled. Except those ""Sent from my iPhone"" tags--until later. She INTENTIONALLY misspelled the other words, and I have no idea why, but it's terrifying that she was controlling her perception to that extent.",0,0
115,Weirdly I had a stalker who also would send one line emails that had a lot of spelling errors and just made no sense at all. It was stream of consciousness. And the more you don’t answer the more unhinged it becomes almost bc it’s like you’re not there so it’s not real in their minds,0,0
242,"Made me feel so icky, I felt so bad for him. And then her saying I made your heart beat after literally assaulting him. Just gross.",0,1
412,It’s also a call back to the first show he did when she was laughing so hard,0,99
172,"Even the cop's comment is basically this. I get that they were sort of friends in the beginning, and that he's getting something from her, but c'mon this is weird",0,99
867,I doubt Richard Gadd knew the backstory of his stalker irl,99,99
210,"Saying that would hurt her though. I'm still only on episode 1, but my interpretation is that he can see she's a woman with serious mental problems, and he doesn't want to add to them by having her crush so utterly reject her. In her state she could be prone to suicide and while he doesn't want to be around her, he is not willing to be the thing that breaks her. So instead he's trying to let her down easy, remaining her friend but rebuffing any overt romantic gestures. However she constantly places him in social situations where the options are to reject her completely or become something more serious, and he keeps trying to defuse those situations with sexual jokes that just serve to encourage her further. The scene with the other bar patrons is a perfect example of this; they forced him into either accepting her as girlfriend or saying ""she's not my girlfriend, I'm just joking around"", which would absolutely devastate her psychologically, so he tried to escape with a joke that she took as a promise. Or the ""date"" they had. She wanted for them to go on a legitimate date, which he turned down. However she pushed by asking what friends do then, which again forced him into either going to get coffee together as friends, or saying ""I'm not your friend"", which once again would be emotionally devastating to her and not something that he is willing to inflict. My understanding is that he doesn't even want to be her friend at all, but how can you reject somebody who want to be your friend without being the bad guy hurting other's emotions for no reason? So he goes with her as a friend, but to her it's their first date. As somebody who hates confrontation and likes to make people happy I sympathise a lot with Gadd's character.",1,99
650,"Very powerful and brave to share this experience and yet, in the age of me too, why hasn't his rapist been identified? The irony that he acknowledges the perceived hypocrisy of reporting the stalker but not the rapist and then the Internet going to all lengths to identify a random, mentally ill woman, but not to identify a famous, powerful rapist is extremely upsetting.",0,99
890,You’re not alone. I think it might be a case of when your brain makes up the letters for you to read the sentence and you’re trying to read it quick before it disappears off screen. I’m just surprised how many people didn’t notice it first time. But then I thought the fact Donny said she didn’t have one and it was always signed off as one was going to be a bigger plot point than it was in the end.,0,99
195,"Okay I just finished ep 1 and I really like it so far. But does anyone else think he’s too…. tolerant/passive idk the word tbh. He found out she’s a convicted stalker and he’s still entertaining her. He could easily shut this whole thing down but I think he’s keeping her around because she makes him a better comedian. If so, I think he’s kinda lame. Gonna watch ep 2 now",0,1
911,"I was confused there as well! Thought it actually happened, not like she would turn him away even though he reported her",0,99
205,"Oh I’m still watching! On ep 2. Just aggravating how he leads her on instead of being straight up sorry I don’t like you and I don’t want to date you, ever let’s not hang out anymore",99,99
271,This guys a fucking idiot just tell her to leave,99,99
1009,Multiple and the angrier she is the worse the spelling.,0,0
272,I wanted to scream at him when he saw she was a jailed criminal stalker and he accepted her friend request,0,1
1150,"There were too many red flags and abuse. But she also gave attention, validation, and affection during one of my lowest time in my life. I’m a logical person. I know right from wrong. I went to meet her to break up, but as soon as I saw her, even though she was verbally abusing me, I craved for that initial attention, validation, and affection she once gave me. I still need it. I didn’t end up following through with the break up. I couldn’t even mutter a word. I was in a trance. Back to my old self. Begging to be loved. That’s how I related to that scene. Hope it helps",1,99
1189,"Her social media accounts are very telling, looked her up out of curiosity after the show and was shocked. I just hope now that the story is out there someone can reach out and offer the help she needs beyond being in prison.",1,99
243,So that’s what she did. Disgusting.,0,99
173,He needs to block her what is he doing 😭😭😭,0,99
206,"Ohhh I read ur first comment too fast LOL yeahhh exactly like if you don’t like her, you can EASILYYYY stop all of this like he’s playing fr",0,99
207,Can’t stand him 😭 or her either,0,99
191,"He's not interested in her, he just likes the attention and adoration.",0,99
950,I think some people may have thought she does have an iPhone but just mimics the message on emails sent from her laptop.,0,0
277,Omg even if you have been getting an ego boost from her once she's following you around work and naming your children it's way past time to DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS Also wow his bosses are garbage. They are just being rude because its not even like she's good business for the bar.,0,1
224,"It’s so wild to be that Gadd both wrote this and plays the main character and it still reads as if the obsession goes both ways. The way he talks about her laugh, the following her home, and the willingness to accept the friend request despite everything. I think this is an example of wanting to have his cake and eat it too. He clearly likes the way she sees him and makes him feel about herself. He just doesn’t like her. The mixed signals are insane and she’s clearly not right in the head. I’m not at all surprised there will be an escalation.",0,1
436,I think she was just saying whores wear boots. It didn’t hit me as a particular clever insult.,0,99
550,Donny is obviously a deeply flawed guy but the way some people blame him more than the actual violent stalker is wild.,0,99
903,Wait but how do we know that? Why was he so nervous talking to the detective and asking “did she say anything? Did she pass anything on?” What was he referring to,99,99
1016,It’s in LITERALLY every single episode. Sometimes she types only “iphon” instead of “sent from my iPhone” I’m not trying to be rude but my god did you watch the show or were you looking at your own iPhone every single episode,0,0
1022,"Yeah I saw the “and then she wins” explanation. But it seems like if someone was really destroying your life and it is exclusively through email, you would simply can that email. No one would view that as letting her win?",0,99
1157,She called immigrants druggies and rapists and said she’d ‘sink their boats’. Tbh I think xenophobia is a more apt description (can’t remember if there was another scene where she was explicitly racist),0,99
1231,"Yeah I don't really know how to put it. It is hard to top all the crazy stuff she does. She lies about being a lawyer and then obsessively stalks someone and leaves thousands of voicemails and all the other stuff she did. She's definitely on the deep end of crazy. But like...he knows that about her. He read everything about her online....and he still dove right in. Like who does that? Whether it was actually because he wanted to use a crazy person to get stories for his comedy career, or maybe wanted to use her for attention, or maybe he was using her for something else I don’t know… but it's kind of fucked up to do that to someone. And he had plenty of opportunities to step away or stop her, but he never quite sets a boundary until things have gone way too far. Early on he could have prevented her from hanging out in the bar by not allowing her to sit for free. Could have told her name to the police much earlier on than he did. He could have not given the crazy stalker lady his email. He could have not spied on her and a number of other things where he just kept sort of...letting her stalk him? And then the whole thing about him getting drugged and raped, and it looked like a pretty traumatic experience, but then goes back for more. He calls it ""grooming"" in his comedy monologue near the end, but I honestly don’t know what to make of all that. His explanation feels dishonest to me because I don't know if you can call it ""grooming"" when both people are trying to use each other for something. And then he listened to thousands of his stalker's voicemails. He basically turned into a maniac who began obsessing/fantasizing over the person who played a role in ruining his relationship with someone he loved ...another thing i don't even know where to begin with. And at least her craziness appears to be the result of trauma, which sort of makes sense. He gives his monologue at the comedy show near the end to explain why he does the things he does..and it’s because he wants fame and hates himself. Something just feels off like there's way more too it than that. And the whole story is from his point of view. I just get the sense he's an unreliable narrator and he's leaving a ton of shit out. This is definitely one of those situations where there's two sides to every story. Granted in this case the story is fascinating cause she's crazy and he's batshit insane.",1,1

202,"Him accepting her friend request, buying her drinks, flirting back, letting her cuddle him, following and spying on her at home??? If you don’t like her Jesus Christ stop all this",0,99
383,All I could tell was she kept calling her a bitch and white and said look at the boots. As like evidence she’s a whore because they are white gogo boots,0,99
1199,"I've not seen anyone say this, but I bawled like a baby hearing her explain ""baby reindeer"". She had horrific abuse and the only constant was her little stuffed animal. She equated him to that toy and seeing her cry when they were taking her to jail just made me feel so incredibly sad for her and what she went through. People with complex trauma like her need intense therapy, not prison (which often just exacerbates their symptoms).",0,99
872,Her 'sent from iPhone' typings are a great barometer to how deranged she is at that moment. When she is particularly excited or enraged the typos come in or she shortens the phrase to just 'iphoen'.,0,99

This person lives in a shitty apartment, eats shitty food, has a drawer of shitty cellphones (that doesn’t have an iPhone btw), but yes, keep assuming she secretly keeps her iPhone at home and doesn’t bring it to the bar (especially when asking for Donny’s number). Good job.",0,99

441,Not sure if this was this episode or episode 2 but I absolutely loved the detail of the misspelling of sent from my iPhone during one of the flashes of the messages on the screen. We all knew she didn’t have an iPhone but such a good callout to the fact that she’s so clearly lying,0,0
554,"Not into the whataboutism of other examples. “Everything is triggering so trigger warnings are [BS, not guaranteed, unnecessary, a privilege, whatever you wanna say].” Basically saying: ‘People are assholes all the time so just get used to it, buddy. If you’re upset, that’s on you.‘ It was a super violent hate crime, a verbal and physical attack, that included xenophobic, misogynistic (trans women are women but even if she just thought she was a woman, still stands) sentiments. If she was truly the villain and it was clear her actions should be considered unethical, evil, etc., perhaps I’d buy the argument. But a tooooonnn of people empathize or sympathize with her, and so it adds nuance to the evaluation of her actions. Before causing harm to viewers who have personal trauma related to these demonstrated actions, it seems like a good time to unequivocally say it’s bad and detestable behavior, and give peeps the option to ~not~ view it if they don’t want to view it. Especially because Netflix is usually a place where people go to escape reality, seems important to caution against catastrophic grounding that may occur. Lastly: You’re the only one who responded accusing me of trying to rile the masses with a warning which would only…..help people? And everyone else would just keep watching?

She knows where he works as well so he has to tread carefully. He wants to “be friends” but she doesn’t respond like most people would, she keeps pushing the boundaries and verbally cornering him. He’s trying to avoid being mean hoping that she’ll take the hint without having to hurt her feelings or react emotionally.",0,0
337,"Bro, what? How would he stop that? Covering her mouth? Pushing her? Throughout the show, she has shown she doesn't care for what he has to say or what he would like her to do. He stepped between them and tried to get her to back up and stop saying stuff multiple times without getting physically aggressive. Sure, he could have done more, but it would require him to get much more physically aggressive. And I don't understand the argument around him letting her hit Terri too long. She's a huge woman who probably weighs damn near 260 if not more. It's gonna be kinda hard to rip her off terri when she's also trying to drop down to hit her.",0,99
1185,One thing that was frustrating to me was his colleagues kept making fun of him and allowed her to egg him on. They didn’t do anything to really stop her from coming into the bar.

368,"Most victims of abuse have some kind of attachment to their abuser. It's often silly, irrational, or self-serving. If you ask a victim of an abusive ex why they stayed, they will tell you a vast majority of the time their mindset at the time was that they loved them or that they offered some kind of stability (a home, income, a job, etc.), or a combination of the two Maybe instead of an exciting love-life for him it was just the platonic relationship with this woman who made him feel special because she was crazy about him. She seemed to help his stand up routine by getting the audience warmed up, there are plenty of abuse victims who endured abuse because it improved their chances at stardom; victims of Harvey Weinstein and P. Diddy have similar stories although less direct. The next episode had something similar with a different abuser that was way more direct. Part of the rest of it seems to be he felt bad for her and felt scared of doing anything. The lack of sympathy from others did a lot to prevent him from doing anything. He co-workers thought she was harmless and wouldn't ban him from the bar. His exes and the police viewed it as a non-problem. He's even unsympathetic to Reddit commenters.

I imagine it gets darker later, but I found it interesting - to me, it seems like there are so many red flags, but he seems mostly unconcerned or oblivious. Is it that women aren't scary? Or maybe I'm just on high alert? Episode one has me giving him the side-eye - he clearly enjoys SOME of the results of interacting with her and seems to be using her. In the comedy club, we see him make a calculated decision. There's a pause and a shift in expression and tone before he leans into mocking her to warm up the crowd and net himself a victory. She's hurt and shows it, but he knows she'll go along with it because of her obsession. Is the obsession ok, then, in his eyes if it's only somewhat manic? Would he feel fine continuing to lead her on and use her attention and emotional support if she was just ""normal"" crazy instead of stalker crazy? The final scene of the episode gave me chills - a guy at work who kept following me and cornering me in the stairwell/parking lot would send me that same song over work slack. It must be a creeper's anthem :P",0,1
