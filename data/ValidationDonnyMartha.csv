OMG I was bawling my eyes out and then laughing my ass off all in the space of three minutes. This show is a real emotional roller coaster.,1093
"I’m sorry for what u have been thru, too ❤️‍🩹",587
"No I don’t think he actually seriously accepted that job, more like he was frozen and confused by the interaction not going how he had planned—my take is that he went there for some some kind of closure but instead fell right back into the same pattern of seeking his abusers validation. It’s a confusing and unsatisfying ending (I was hoping there’d be some sort of confrontation), but ultimately probably a lot more realistic to what an abused person would do. It’s that rawness and vulnerability that makes this show special imo",1222
I hope they delve into Donny's childhood. Wouldn't be surprised if his mother had a psychiatric illness too,227
Love that ❤️,988
Brown skinned? I've seen darker Italians.,377
Ah crap now that im halfway through the show i get why hes like that 🫠,270
damn't i'm trying to understand how to fix this destructive path - one of things comes up to my mind is - do opposite to understand that there is other ways/feelings? like why self desecration is must have for him?,917
I don’t think we’re meant to feel sorry for him. He certainly hasn’t set up the show for us to think that way.,281
Does it make a difference if the show is real or not??,1207
Found some of his confidencr,985
Yep just did and makes so much sense now. Also can’t believe this actually happened to the actor in his real life & he is the writer and director of this show!!!,751
"yeah, this. He wasn't snarling or anything. bloody haunting seeing him casually being a monster.",682
"Yes, it is",111
Why or when would any gay man want to sleep with a woman? When do gay men ever sleep with trans women? They don’t it’s almost like they’re not attracted to WOMEN,512
"1. Be civil, polite and courteous. No trolling. Treat others with respect and kindness. This show is bound to elicit big feelings for many viewers. As contributors post and comment in this sub, treat each other with respect and kindness.",692
"Very helpful, thank you! I want to watch the episode but I can do with skipping the scene.",658
[deleted],643
"I fuckin wheezed when it went from 'Sent from my iPhone"" to just ""iphone"" 💀",442
Him. Martha told them he was in the hospital after a car accident.,937
I just wanna give Donny a big hug,1003
"I hate that Darrien was not punished. He’s just a horrible person. I hope he didn’t end up working for him! I think I have to watch the ending episode again. I read reviews before I watched Reindeer and some reviewers said this was a dark comedy. It was not what I was expecting. Unfortunately, a lot of artists who struggle to make a place for themselves in the entertainment industry fall prey to established but demented people who use their status in the industry for doing horrible things.",1172
"He can't find arousal/no longer associates sex with a healthy relationship. The only way he can get turned on anymore is by committing acts of self desecration, and the most self destructive path for him is to fuck Martha (who is the most external representation/surrogate for his life spiralling into ruin).",916
Wow! What a dark episode! I had to look away so many times while they were displaying the drug scenes.,806
"No label. It's one of those ""don't announce, share if asked"" kind of things. For most people, there is only one person who needs to know the genitalia they prefer. You don't need a label for information communicated so rarely and intimately.",535
"That was not a funny moment. Heartbreaking, but not funny.",1091
Lol I don't know if she's meant to be latina but she's definitely not white. Quite sure that's intentional in the casting as well.,351
It was frustrating but a very real depiction at how men don't take other mens' victimization seriously (especially if their abuser is a woman),1186
"It's very rare for a tv episode or a film to have such a profound effect on me as this did. Must admit that I had to pause it after the most harrowing scenes, then go back to finish the episode after a few minutes to decompress and calm down. Reading some of the earlier comments it looks like a lot of people who have suffered SA have found the episode and series helpful. More power to you all - and to Richard Gadd.",822
"I have not binge watched a show in one sitting in years until this show. Raw. Real. Brilliant. I felt disgusted, I felt validated. It accomplished the impossible. The scene in the courtroom where Martha is whimpering baby reindeer and the last voicemail actually made me feel a touch of empathy for a racist, homophobic, stalking, sexual assailant! Just bravo. I really hope this show and all the people who worked on it gets their flowers. Just perfection.",1155
I think it was a more raw portrayal of the post trauma behavior. That’s what hit me hard Him being a man is definitely part of the shock factor because we don’t tend to see men as the victims of SA/rape in film. Also as someone that has been anally raped (I’m a cis woman) there was something extra violating to me about that particular type and so that was extra jarring to me as well,813
Teri is a badass and deserves better than this mess,546
"so hard to watch. i know it was beautifully made, but i just cannot handle watching his meltdown in front of so many people. the self pity, the trauma dumping, and the admitting that he was a failing artist hit so close. of all places to admit to what's happened to him, he really chose his comedy gig?? martha and darrien had ruined him beyond fixing. i feel so bad for him. i wonder how it's all going to end.",1019
"Could be the demand supply thing but I also found something on why Donny shouldn't have been judged even if it were true- By their very nature, human beings are so capricious so complex so delightfully contradictory that they deserve not only consideration but our reconsiderations - and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.",933
"Because Martha is the only one to be able to recognize his abuse without him having to explicitly tell people. He can’t tell people because of the shame. That’s the grip Martha has on him; she can see he was abused. Even in that intimate fantasy, she says something about him being abused.",926
"I fully agree, opened wounds for me as well but I felt kind of settled and understood afterwards. A lot of the things I did after did not make sense to a lot of people, not even to me, and now, especially with his depiction after his assault, I realize it fucks you up. You won’t be completely rational, especially not as a young person. It’s normal to be abnormal after something like that happens to you.",705
"Donny ends up writing “baby reindeer”, the series we all watched, and goes back to his rapist, who is possibly an influential figure in some network… I immediately thought that maybe he is the guy that “helps” Donny get this show on Netflix. Is he a Netflix producer/writer? Anyone else have this thought?",1224
The US census literally labeled middle easterners as white though. A lot of which look like her. Stop trying to act like these people are minorities when they aren’t.,502
OMG. I was screaming at him. Does the show explicitly tell us that he didn't go over there?,899
"ESPECIALLY after what went down at the bar with Teri at the end, can someone explain why the cops have STILL not been called? I feel like all of this could have been avoided…",314
Just finished this episode. What a nightmare. I hope that's the worst thing that happens. I'm still disturbed by it.,811
I remember jumping into two hookups because I felt it was an attempt to get my power back and make sense of what happened to me. At the time it didnt register that thats what I was doing. Or just like him attempting to desensitize and “not care” but the impact would always be the same. The show portrays this perfectly,619
Chatgpt,188
I doubt Richard Gadd knew the backstory of his stalker irl,867
"I think he is thinking of his guilt at the end, it bothered me too as to why he didn’t immediately help her up.. I think she does assume Teri is trans (especially as transphobics refer to trans as rapists) and throwing in the xenophobia as well. She is bald because Farta ripped her hair out. This ending brought me to tears because of the discrimination and hate crimes that people throw at others... not many of those types have to be as bat shit crazy as Martha to spew that hatred",388
"This is so incredibly wrong. Predators take advantage of imperfect inhumans (as we all are) - it doesn't matter if it was a teacher or family member or, in this case, a ""friend"". It's just as horrific and is absolutely rape.",799
It isn't a true story.,109
don't worry the spinoff is coming MAMA REINDEER: AN ORIGIN STORY,869
What happened at the end?? Who was his mam and dad saying was in the hospital??,936
"2. No discrimination. No bigoted language, use of racial slurs or discrimination based on color, gender, race, sexual orientation or nationality. If you encounter such comments, report them.",467
"My theory is he likes the power imbalance and how it fuels his ego. He's literally benefiting from everyone's dysfunction - living with a woman who just lost her son (i assume for lower rent), dating a trans woman of color as a white cis male, entertaining a stalker who is more full-sized and thus traditionally lacking the privilege of the woman of typical beauty standards. Lots of coincidental situations like that here but he opts into and perpetuates each of these interactions... He also clearly doesn't see Teri as a woman. Like he's ashamed to be with her in public so he must be aware that there's a power imbalance and that she is somewhat in a disadvantage by society's standards, which makes him feel like a big man (same reason he picked construction as a job for his fantasy identity).",494
One thing that was frustrating to me was his colleagues kept making fun of him and allowed her to egg him on. They didn’t do anything to really stop her from coming into the bar. Even at the comedy show when it escalated quickly security just sat around until he had to say 2-3 times please kick her out.,1185
Cried during this and definitely been there. I've definitely ruined a relationship because I hated myself more than I loved him. I've gotten to where that's reversed itself but it's too late now and it's hard to deal with sometimes.,1053
Is this from this episode or episode 7? I don't recall a viral video mentioned in this episode.,996
[removed],169
"I had to take a break from this series to get through it in a healthy way. But my god, what a show! I sat there, dumbfounded on multiple occasions, but no more so than the scene where Donny goes to Martha's window and finally hangs her curtains. Actually froze up in confusion for a good few minutes while that played out.",1226
Teri is a latina,339
Bingo.,200
"Me, too. So many of us. Still can't tell if that it was for the better or not. How are you doing?",680
Did anyone else cringe at Donny’s jokes? It was painfully cringe,409
"I have friends that I think are very comedic. They often have a mantra of doing things “for the story” or “for the lolz.” It’s almost a self-sabotaging behavior where they are the butt of the joke and they lean into it. A lot of comedians are depicted this way in the show “Crashing.” It’s not at all surprising, as an aspiring comic, that he leans into this hilarious and dark experience.",179
Literally! It is absolutely brilliant in every sense of the word that I want to tell everyone but also don’t know if I can 😭,975
I was ready to turn the entire show off.,865
They haven't seen Scum,814
Thx! You too Idk why someone would down vote my reply but okay!,707
It’s also a call back to the first show he did when she was laughing so hard,412
"I don't think so. I think Cottonmouth was likely an older long finished comedy show, like ones in the 80s. From the details Richard gives in interviews, the assault happened around 2012",648
The part in the monologue where he details how much he only loves and can love hating himself. The abuse he has suffered has warped his mind so much that he can only head towards more abuse.,1023
Exactly!! Thats what most people don’t get if they havent been in situations like these. People often look at things from right / wrong. He could for example: - Be in denial - Blame himself - Be too ashamed / scared to face the real world after the abuse - Convince himself he wanted it or that he was apart of it - Want his validation - Have a strong belief that this is his only way to success - Have feelings for the abuser I had some serious feelings for my abuser and it made it difficult for me to be honest about my feelings of the abuse. These things are messy and really fuck with your head and often times we excuse the abuser and find fault in ourselves instead.,746
Maybe so that would make sense,384
Thank you! I was SO confused and hoping this was the case!,908
"The scene where Donny confesses everything to his parents was one of the most heart wrenching things I've ever seen on TV. The performance of the father was subtle and yet so powerful. Just the words ""I grew up in the Catholic Church"" and Donny's slow realisation. Just a masterfully crafted scene.",1205
"Like I said, they are woman (and I will identify them as such), but THEIR experience as a woman is a trans experience (under a different umbrella) then mine as a biological woman. So by default they are not the same but under the same main umbrella. I’m sorry. But im not changing my mind on that.",481
"1. Be civil, polite and courteous. No trolling. No victim-blaming. Treat others with respect and kindness. This show is bound to elicit big feelings for many viewers. As contributors post and comment in this sub, treat each other with respect and kindness.",558
Maybe pansexual,540
[deleted],505
Sadly not everyone always rationally after trauma,174
"I actually watched the real stand up act a couple of days ago but that doesn't even matter. Because I said what I felt and I still feel that. Recreating the horrors of one's life is never easy, neither in a stand up act, nor in a Netflix series. Hats off to Richard Gadd for that.",990
I’m intrigued by it but don’t understand how she could have been a graduate lawyer if she can barely spell. I’m hoping more is revealed which explains this as it’s a bit distracting.,114
Why did you put a spoiler for episode 7. You ruined that bit for me mate,1001
">!Actually, u/ArtlessAnarchist is wrong. [This is the video of the real event](https://youtu.be/XwezEmsp8uY?si=5-HOs7UDUL6n7LFN), and the scene in the show is just a reenactment!< **EDIT: IMPORTANT, I JUST REALIZED THAT u/Useful-Confidence POSTED SPOILERS in their original comment WITHOUT WARNING US; THEIR ORIGINAL COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM EPISODE 7 CONTAINING IMPORTANT INFORMATION. This thread should ONLY discuss Episode 6… I myself hadn’t even begun Episode 7 when I originally replied to this comment thread; I was at the time unknowingly EXPOSED to spoilers and super CONFUSED as a result… So, THE REDDITOR u/ArtlessAnarchist WAS ALSO A VICTIM OF SPOILERS AND NOT INCORRECT in their response at all. It was the spoilers that was posted by u/Useful-Confidence, without warning, that made everything confusing… Upon realizing now that I was exposed to spoilers, I now updated my response to add the spoiler filter feature for all of the text in my reply, I PLEASE REQUEST THE ORIGINAL COMMENT BY u/Useful-Confidence TO INCORPORATE SPOILER TEXT FEATURE HIDING THEIR TEXT (like I did with my text upon editing this comment) TO AVOID FURTHER SPOILING EPISODE 7 AND CAUSING CONFUSION TO REDDITORS LIKE MYSELF WHO STUMBLE UPON THEIR COMMENT.…**",989
"Lmao, sometimes I look back on the shit I said and did when I was in love...and just cringe. But it's not a real relationship if you can't be completely weird with each other.",139
"It’s true, unfortunately. This is must be his way of naming his tormentor.",1176
[removed],167
or maybe they are big in size....,386
Oh wow he said that??? Then maybe that explains it 🫣,214
"It depends on how the person with female genitalia identifies. Normally that's just called a preference. You can have preferences for certain genitalia and it doesn't mean you're transphobic. People are allowed to be attracted to certain things, we all are. A cis man attracted to a trans man, who may still have female genitalia he was born with, can be straight, or bisexual, or a gay man because he's attracted to a trans man - and of course I'll say this as a trans man myself- trans men are men. Sometimes cis men can be chasers. Which is a bad thing. It's a man who fetishizes trans people's genitalia, like they're obsessed with it or only see us as sexual objects. Which is obviously wrong. I'm a full person regardless of what 'equipment' I was born with, so to speak. I don't know if I fully understand this particular question, to be honest. If the man is attracted to a woman, trans or cis, who had female genitalia, then he's most likely straight, or could happen to be bisexual >!like in the show.!< But it doesn't take away the fact that trans women, like the one in the show, are to be seen and treated as real women regardless of what genitalia they have, because that's what they are and identify as.",534
So a man?,463
"The freak out while he was on acid got my heart beating, genuinely more horrifying than any horror or thriller film I’ve watched recently. And I watch a lot. I’ve had bad trips before and also experienced same sex sexual assault, I cannot imagine having realizations about being in a bad situation while incredibly fucked up. It’s fucking painful and this episode was so disturbing and uncomfortable and sad. I just wanted to cry with him and hug him. Between this and I May Destroy you, sexual assault has been put in such a raw and real, but not sexually gratuitous way, like so many shows do.",769
That makes a lot of sense. Attempting to take control of the narrative so-to-speak.,1109
Oh my god I started bawling at that scene too,976
Multiple and the angrier she is the worse the spelling.,1009
Says the person who has no empathy for sexual assault survivors that have gone to a comedy show for a bit of light entertainment and have been forcefully retraumatised.,1048
Be warned--there are a lot of accounts impersonating Fiona (IRL Martha).,1013
"Also, Teri is a peach but why exactly is Donny dating a Trans woman if he's not gay? Or is he bisexual?",459
Sad that she’s moved on with a new guy,1060
"This ranks up there with very few shows for me in the terms of depth and real, human emotion. This made me feel similarly to how I felt when I watched Six Feet Under. Definitely a tough watch, but just so beautifully done and so important. When Donny’s father spoke of his own abuse.. that and Martha’s last message gutted me!",1181
I also wonder what happened to Donny to have made him go through so much with him.,870
"Honest question, if we agree, why do you feel the need to post this last message? It's like you're adding an asterisk to the statement that we are agreeing on ""trans women are women"" and that feels iffy to me.",482
"I didn’t mean literally, but by telling the story he is giving clues to who his tormentor was.",1178
