And he had plenty of opportunities to step away or stop her, but he never quite sets a boundary until things have gone way too far.

Not victim blaming, i’m calling it like it is. He was also confused about his sexuality, that’s why as soon as he stopped messing around with that man. He was having sex with a lot of different men.

I'm still only on episode 1, but my interpretation is that he can see she's a woman with serious mental problems, and he doesn't want to add to them by having her crush so utterly reject her. In her state she could be prone to suicide and while he doesn't want to be around her, he is not willing to be the thing that breaks her. So instead he's trying to let her down easy, remaining her friend but rebuffing any overt romantic gestures. However she constantly places him in social situations where the options are to reject her completely or become something more serious, and he keeps trying to defuse those situations with sexual jokes that just serve to encourage her further. The scene with the other bar patrons is a perfect example of this; they forced him into either accepting her as girlfriend or saying ""she's not my girlfriend, I'm just joking around"", which would absolutely devastate her psychologically, so he tried to escape with a joke that she took as a promise. Or the ""date"" they had. She wanted for them to go on a legitimate date, which he turned down. However she pushed by asking what friends do then, which again forced him into either going to get coffee together as friends, or saying ""I'm not your friend"", which once again would be emotionally devastating to her and not something that he is willing to inflict. My understanding is that he doesn't even want to be her friend at all, but how can you reject somebody who want to be your friend without being the bad guy hurting other's emotions for no reason? So he goes with her as a friend, but to her it's their first date. As somebody who hates confrontation and likes to make people happy I sympathise a lot with Gadd's character.

Maybe he was actually incapable of getting a job to pay rent, but it appears to be his choice. Anyway, his own parents didn’t appear to be financially support him or his ex. Seemed questionable that he would get it from someone else’s twice-divorced, single mom. Just a theory though as I wasn’t there.. It is def abusing/using someone to create a false identity on a dating profile while allowing your counterpart to be vulnerable and reveal their full identity (power differential right there). It is even worse to create a false identity and target a disadvantaged population that is already targeted by creeps and bigots (another power difference). His whole alter ego w/Teri - as he said in the show - was to make himself feel manly (again, being the manliest man and balancing power a thing). Power difference isn’t always inherently bad btw - some cis men prefer much shorter women. But the fact that Gadd specifically targeted trans women is akin to cis white men targeting Asian women (in the fetishizing way). There’s a reason they’re doing that and it’s the perceived power differential. He is clearly using Martha and gets off on her obsession (quite literally). He engages with her and eggs her on even though he wants nothing to do with her. She’s also using him and what she’s doing is inexcusable and a crime. But Teri noted verbatim in the show: Gadd likes the attention from Martha. That’s why he continues to engage instead of appropriately cutting her off.

This ending brought me to tears because of the discrimination and hate crimes that people throw at others... not many of those types have to be as bat shit crazy as Martha to spew that hatred	
",1,Soliddivinity,"I think he is thinking of his guilt at the end, it bothered me too as to why he didn’t immediately help her up.. I think she does assume Teri is trans (especially as transphobics refer to trans as rapists) and throwing in the xenophobia as well. She is bald because Farta ripped her hair out.

267,"Baby Reindeer | S1E03 | Episode Discussion 	2	gmanz33	I find it fascinating that this is how the ex-gf phrased it (a distanced, non-loving way of explaining his situation) when the show is a literal display of all of the actual reasons he kept her around. Loving the drama and 'having nothing in your life to focus on except that drama' or being drawn to that because the rest of your life is scary and/or monotonous? The dude was in the process of coming out in this late 20's, nobody gets out of that unscathed. It's just so funny to me that this show works HARD to explain that he doesn't love the drama as much as he needs and escapes through it, but sure we'll go with the easy summary.

Like men who have been abused might read threads like these and think they should stay quiet. If Martha was a man, the response would be different.

She had horrific abuse and the only constant was her little stuffed animal. She equated him to that toy and seeing her cry when they were taking her to jail just made me feel so incredibly sad for her and what she went through. People with complex trauma like her need intense therapy, not prison (which often just exacerbates their symptoms).
