Definitely seems like he’s a man who’s unhappy with his circumstances, disappointed by his career and love life enjoying the attention this person is bringing to his life.

"Baby Reindeer | S1E01 | Episode Discussion 	1	Pawneewafflesarelife	I've only watched episode one, but as a woman who was stalked I didn't feel flattered or intrigued by the stalking, I was scared! I imagine it gets darker later, but I found it interesting - to me, it seems like there are so many red flags, but he seems mostly unconcerned or oblivious. Is it that women aren't scary? Or maybe I'm just on high alert? Episode one has me giving him the side-eye - he clearly enjoys SOME of the results of interacting with her and seems to be using her. In the comedy club, we see him make a calculated decision. There's a pause and a shift in expression and tone before he leans into mocking her to warm up the crowd and net himself a victory. She's hurt and shows it, but he knows she'll go along with it because of her obsession. Is the obsession ok, then, in his eyes if it's only somewhat manic? Would he feel fine continuing to lead her on and use her attention and emotional support if she was just ""normal"" crazy instead of stalker crazy? The final scene of the episode gave me chills - a guy at work who kept following me and cornering me in the stairwell/parking lot would send me that same song over work slack. It must be a creeper's anthem :P

"Baby Reindeer | S1E01 | Episode Discussion 	4	Sahaal_17	Saying that would hurt her though. I'm still only on episode 1, but my interpretation is that he can see she's a woman with serious mental problems, and he doesn't want to add to them by having her crush so utterly reject her. In her state she could be prone to suicide and while he doesn't want to be around her, he is not willing to be the thing that breaks her. So instead he's trying to let her down easy, remaining her friend but rebuffing any overt romantic gestures. However she constantly places him in social situations where the options are to reject her completely or become something more serious, and he keeps trying to defuse those situations with sexual jokes that just serve to encourage her further. The scene with the other bar patrons is a perfect example of this; they forced him into either accepting her as girlfriend or saying ""she's not my girlfriend, I'm just joking around"", which would absolutely devastate her psychologically, so he tried to escape with a joke that she took as a promise. Or the ""date"" they had. She wanted for them to go on a legitimate date, which he turned down. However she pushed by asking what friends do then, which again forced him into either going to get coffee together as friends, or saying ""I'm not your friend"", which once again would be emotionally devastating to her and not something that he is willing to inflict. My understanding is that he doesn't even want to be her friend at all, but how can you reject somebody who want to be your friend without being the bad guy hurting other's emotions for no reason? So he goes with her as a friend, but to her it's their first date. As somebody who hates confrontation and likes to make people happy I sympathise a lot with Gadd's character.

Throughout the show, she has shown she doesn't care for what he has to say or what he would like her to do. He stepped between them and tried to get her to back up and stop saying stuff multiple times without getting physically aggressive. Sure, he could have done more, but it would require him to get much more physically aggressive. And I don't understand the argument around him letting her hit Terri too long. She's a huge woman who probably weighs damn near 260 if not more. It's gonna be kinda hard to rip her off terri when she's also trying to drop down to hit her.

"Baby Reindeer | S1E03 | Episode Discussion 	5	dearitsquinoa	So the housing is one of three examples. Fwiw could def be my American perspective - community is not as big here as in Europe. Staying in your ex’s Mom’s house so you can pursue your dreams of being a comedian is not what I see as a two-way relationship though, which is why I think I cringed in seeing that. Maybe he was actually incapable of getting a job to pay rent, but it appears to be his choice. Anyway, his own parents didn’t appear to be financially support him or his ex. Seemed questionable that he would get it from someone else’s twice-divorced, single mom. Just a theory though as I wasn’t there.. It is def abusing/using someone to create a false identity on a dating profile while allowing your counterpart to be vulnerable and reveal their full identity (power differential right there). It is even worse to create a false identity and target a disadvantaged population that is already targeted by creeps and bigots (another power difference). His whole alter ego w/Teri - as he said in the show - was to make himself feel manly (again, being the manliest man and balancing power a thing). Power difference isn’t always inherently bad btw - some cis men prefer much shorter women. But the fact that Gadd specifically targeted trans women is akin to cis white men targeting Asian women (in the fetishizing way). There’s a reason they’re doing that and it’s the perceived power differential. He is clearly using Martha and gets off on her obsession (quite literally). He engages with her and eggs her on even though he wants nothing to do with her. She’s also using him and what she’s doing is inexcusable and a crime. But Teri noted verbatim in the show: Gadd likes the attention from Martha. That’s why he continues to engage instead of appropriately cutting her off. Last episode shows he’s still addicted to her attention at the end. TBC, was not excusing everyone else around Gadd, but noting that there is no real good guy here which is what’s refreshing about the show.

" Baby Reindeer | S1E04 | Episode Discussion 	0	M_bigboots	On a binge right now, just got to this episode. Was so sad when he got assaulted by Martha in the alley way. Was even more upset during the entirety of episode 4. As someone who was r@ped under the influence I entirely understand the blame,the shame, the hyper sexuality afterwards, the violent thoughts, and even the porn addiction. This episode touched on so many horrific and realistic details about sexual assault and rape and would of course trigger and make anyone uneasy. But that’s not a bad thing (in my opinion) we need more representation like this is the media, and to feel heard and seen especially male victims. As gruesome and real as these details were, it made me realize some things about my own assault. It wasn’t my fault, even if under the influence I didn’t deserve what happened and my ways of coping afterwards even if not always healthy were valid and normal. To all victims who felt triggered by this episode , I feel you and hear you and hope you get the justice and peace you deserve.

He went back 4-5 times after waking up to a dick in his mouth/being assaulted because he “hated himself.” So I was kind of right about the self sabotage/destructive behaviour he was participating in. He had low self esteem so he didn’t want to cut himself from the only source saying he was going to make it.

"Baby Reindeer | S1E06 | Episode Discussion 	0	susucita	I thought the monologue/meltdown was so beautifully done. One of the lines that stuck with me was: “I loved one thing in the world more than her [Teri] - hating myself.” It reminded me of one of the most moving stories I’ve ever read on Humans of NY, about a guy who spiraled into addiction after being groomed and abused as a kid, finally got clean to regain custody of his young son, and eventually fell in love with a woman who had her own history of addiction. The story ends with him saying that he wants his son to know that he saved him - “because I always loved you more than I hated myself” (cue crying). The line in Baby Reindeer is the inverse of this, but I felt that it was similarly hopeful because of how cathartic it was - hopefully the first step in a long journey of healing. Overall, I thought this was an incredible series - a mix of black comedy, thriller, and emotional gut punch. I think someone else mentioned this in another thread, but it reminded me a little of I May Destroy You, another brilliant show that explores trauma and the boundaries of consent.

His explanation feels dishonest to me because I don't know if you can call it ""grooming"" when both people are trying to use each other for something. And then he listened to thousands of his stalker's voicemails. He basically turned into a maniac who began obsessing/fantasizing over the person who played a role in ruining his relationship with someone he loved ...another thing i don't even know where to begin with. And at least her craziness appears to be the result of trauma, which sort of makes sense. He gives his monologue at the comedy show near the end to explain why he does the things he does..and it’s because he wants fame and hates himself. Something just feels off like there's way more too it than that. And the whole story is from his point of view. I just get the sense he's an unreliable narrator and he's leaving a ton of shit out. This is definitely one of those situations where there's two sides to every story. Granted in this case the story is fascinating cause she's crazy and he's batshit insane.",1231,1230,0,1
