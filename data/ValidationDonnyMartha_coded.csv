"As my therapist put it, “when a person goes through abnormal circumstances, it’s normal for them to behave abnormally.” Hearing that helped me to stop judging myself so harshly for ways I had responded to abuse. I hope it gives you the same comfort or at least, helps you knowing that you’re not alone ❤️",1114,0,0

"No, it’s kind of extreme. It’s super uncomfortable. Especially when you’re just watching him allow it happen and you don’t really understand why he’s allowing it to happen. It’s super confusing overall. I wish I never had watched episode together. Pretty weird. Edit: after finishing the episode. And the series. You do need to watch episode four in order to continue the series. The beginning of episode four is super brutal tho",711,1,0

Society has become very anti-social. Its so difficult to interact with people and start conversation. Its easier with people you might repetitively see on a regular basis so the desire for more interaction coupled with lack of social skills creates a feedback of anxiety and those fears become this awkward jumbley mess trying to interact with people you think you know. And no one wants to hang out with random people so its just enforces those feeling of being alone.,1184,0,0
"Yes! Sometimes I look back at my behavior while with my abuser, and it’s so confusing why I did the things I did. The thought of seeing her would make me nauseous, and then I’d be hopping on 2 buses and 2 trains to travel 5 hours to be with her for a full weekend. The choices we make don’t always make sense when we’re so deeply manipulated and traumatized, and I appreciate him showing the nuances of that.",584,0,0

"It's definitely completely obvious it's in his mind.

"It depends on how the person with female genitalia identifies. Normally that's just called a preference. You can have preferences for certain genitalia and it doesn't mean you're transphobic. People are allowed to be attracted to certain things, we all are. A cis man attracted to a trans man, who may still have female genitalia he was born with, can be straight, or bisexual, or a gay man because he's attracted to a trans man - and of course I'll say this as a trans man myself- trans men are men. Sometimes cis men can be chasers. Which is a bad thing. It's a man who fetishizes trans people's genitalia, like they're obsessed with it or only see us as sexual objects. Which is obviously wrong. I'm a full person regardless of what 'equipment' I was born with, so to speak. I don't know if I fully understand this particular question, to be honest. If the man is attracted to a woman, trans or cis, who had female genitalia, then he's most likely straight, or could happen to be bisexual >!like in the show.!< But it doesn't take away the fact that trans women, like the one in the show, are to be seen and treated as real women regardless of what genitalia they have, because that's what they are and identify as.",534,0,0

"That was one time which brings me to my original statement, I don’t understand why he continue to go back. but after I continue to watch, I understood why he continued to go back. He was a drug addict that was seeking fame. He wasn’t drugged. He was taking drugs. Big difference.",719,1,0

"Let's say someone steals your bicycle. If you really cared about this bicycle, maybe your mom gave it to you as a gift, you would be really upset by the theft. You lost something really important to your heart. But instead, you tell yourself, this bicycle was garbage, it was almost broken anyway, it's just cheap junk, the theft matters less to you. What happened is Maybe they even did you a favor by taking away trash you needed to throw away. For Donnie he is the bicycle. He was violated by the writer. But if Donnie treats his body and more importantly, believes that his body and sexuality is worthless and deserves to be violated and treated badly, then what the writer did is not a problem. He lost nothing that didn't deserve to be lost.",920,1,0

Does Terri have a PENIS though? I think a straight guy wouldn’t be attracted to a person with a PENIS.

I thought that’s what pansexual is. Pansexual wouldn’t be straight or else like why come up with a whole new label pansexual.,531,1,0

"Yeah I don't really know how to put it. It is hard to top all the crazy stuff she does. She lies about being a lawyer and then obsessively stalks someone and leaves thousands of voicemails and all the other stuff she did. She's definitely on the deep end of crazy. But like...he knows that about her. He read everything about her online....and he still dove right in. Like who does that? Whether it was actually because he wanted to use a crazy person to get stories for his comedy career, or maybe wanted to use her for attention, or maybe he was using her for something else I don’t know… but it's kind of fucked up to do that to someone. And he had plenty of opportunities to step away or stop her, but he never quite sets a boundary until things have gone way too far. Early on he could have prevented her from hanging out in the bar by not allowing her to sit for free. Could have told her name to the police much earlier on than he did. He could have not given the crazy stalker lady his email. He could have not spied on her and a number of other things where he just kept sort of...letting her stalk him? And then the whole thing about him getting drugged and raped, and it looked like a pretty traumatic experience, but then goes back for more. He calls it ""grooming"" in his comedy monologue near the end, but I honestly don’t know what to make of all that. His explanation feels dishonest to me because I don't know if you can call it ""grooming"" when both people are trying to use each other for something. And then he listened to thousands of his stalker's voicemails. He basically turned into a maniac who began obsessing/fantasizing over the person who played a role in ruining his relationship with someone he loved ...another thing i don't even know where to begin with. And at least her craziness appears to be the result of trauma, which sort of makes sense. He gives his monologue at the comedy show near the end to explain why he does the things he does..and it’s because he wants fame and hates himself. Something just feels off like there's way more too it than that. And the whole story is from his point of view. I just get the sense he's an unreliable narrator and he's leaving a ton of shit out. This is definitely one of those situations where there's two sides to every story. Granted in this case the story is fascinating cause she's crazy and he's batshit insane.",1231,1,1

"Most victims of abuse have some kind of attachment to their abuser. It's often silly, irrational, or self-serving. If you ask a victim of an abusive ex why they stayed, they will tell you a vast majority of the time their mindset at the time was that they loved them or that they offered some kind of stability (a home, income, a job, etc.), or a combination of the two Maybe instead of an exciting love-life for him it was just the platonic relationship with this woman who made him feel special because she was crazy about him. She seemed to help his stand up routine by getting the audience warmed up, there are plenty of abuse victims who endured abuse because it improved their chances at stardom; victims of Harvey Weinstein and P. Diddy have similar stories although less direct. The next episode had something similar with a different abuser that was way more direct. Part of the rest of it seems to be he felt bad for her and felt scared of doing anything. The lack of sympathy from others did a lot to prevent him from doing anything. He co-workers thought she was harmless and wouldn't ban him from the bar. His exes and the police viewed it as a non-problem. He's even unsympathetic to Reddit commenters. Telling victims of abuse to *just leave* sounds easy enough but how difficult it is can be hard to understand.",368,1,1

"I thought it was so interesting that the show ended just how it started… like the similarities between Martha & Donny. The final scene is Donny walking into that bar, alone and sad, ordering a drink, not having his wallet, and the bartending giving it to him for free, likely because he pitied him. This is the exact same situation as how he met Martha- she came into the bar, sad and alone, he pitied her and gave her the free drink. It almost makes me think that Donny is now going to be obsessed with the nice bartender who gave him the free drink? I don’t really think that’s what happened next, but I do think he realized the similarities between himself then and there and the situation of how he first met Martha. I also thought it was interesting this lasted for about 3 years- 2014-2017 wasn’t it? It really puts it into perspective why he almost/ did ‘miss’ her, because she became so involved in his life, whether he liked it or not, he got so used to it. Overall, I really loved the series! Very great acting and thought provoking. So crazy and sad it’s based on a true story.",1193,1,1
