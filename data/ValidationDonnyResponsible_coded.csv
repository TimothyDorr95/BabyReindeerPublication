381,"I also think he realizes how far he‚Äôs gone with this. It was interesting at first and he literally added her as a Facebook friend for his comedy. And that led to this ending, literally his fault just as much as Martha‚Äôs",0,1
207,Can‚Äôt stand him üò≠ or her either,0,99
984,I wanted someone in the audience to jump up and give him a hug as we walked out!,1,99
366,The ex Keelie (dunno how to spell it) did insinuate he loves drama,0,99
192,Even from the picnic thing in the bar you can see how someone might think that he was interested in her. Also he quickly sees that she is very possessive and that doesn't rise any flags.,0,1
590,The scenes where he explains his coping mechanisms and his thoughts throughout were so painfully relatable. I just sat there shocked after the episode ended.,1,99
1033,But he said nothing new basically. He just recapped the entire show again.,0,99
419,Especially the physical comedy. Yikes But then the audience would laugh so i wonder if we the viewers are supposed to find him funny as wellü•¥,0,99
323,"May be late to the party, but there were TONS of times in this episode where I was screaming inside ‚Äújust call the cops‚Äù! Maybe as a man he felt shame in outside help (only starting ep 4)?",0,0
1178,"I didn‚Äôt mean literally, but by telling the story he is giving clues to who his tormentor was.",0,0
153,"Thank you! There‚Äôs fight, flight, freeze, and fawn (along of those responses). Freeze and fawning are what I‚Äôve seen so far in episode one. I feel deeply for him.",1,99
286,"His friend are horrid, I like that hes not lying about how he was during this time.",0,99
453,"I'm glad one person came around and realized. People have been victim blaming him so much. It's insane. Like men who have been abused might read threads like these and think they should stay quiet. If Martha was a man, the response would be different.",1,0
1021,Please watch his monologue again.,99,99
299,His colleagues want him to date the old crazy stalker felon,99,99
197,"Hmm that‚Äôs an interesting take. But I think he knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing. I just finished ep 2 and I still feel the same if not more. If he cared about her as a friend, wouldn‚Äôt he try to get her some help? I also think Martha reminds him of someone from his past. It would explain his strange attachment towards her",0,1
213,Yeah I can't believe that she was fully already a convicted stalker and he kept on with it! In interviews about the show he's said that she needs mental help but also maybe he does.,0,1
1185,One thing that was frustrating to me was his colleagues kept making fun of him and allowed her to egg him on. They didn‚Äôt do anything to really stop her from coming into the bar. Even at the comedy show when it escalated quickly security just sat around until he had to say 2-3 times please kick her out.,0,0
580,"I decided I would get too triggered if I were to watch Episode 4, but I have read about it now. So grateful that the writer created this show. As a survivor of childhood sexual assault and later stalking‚Ä¶.this resonates with me 100 percent. He was super brave to bring up all of the topics in such a nuanced way. I hope he knows how much I needed this validation",1,99
387,It's certainly partially his fault but I think it's a little more Martha's fault!,0,1
328,he is lowkey selfish and that was soooo amplified by his disregard for teri's safety. emotionally and physically as a trans woman! like ugh. i am not the biggest fan of him as a character. and i hope the real life Teri got an apology before he made this show.,0,99
185,"Top that off, the complete table turn with his female stalker is getting harassed by randos on the internet (which I don‚Äôt condone)",0,0
204,wait wym?? I finished the show btw so I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything but this literally means he‚Äôs not naive he knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing.,0,1
324,"Anyone else frustrated by how long he let Martha spit racial slurs at Teri? And how long it took him to get Martha off of her? Him telling Martha off was so satisfying, sad that he only got the balls after his date was hate crimed. Great storytelling and acting, I‚Äôm so hooked.",0,0
926,"Because Martha is the only one to be able to recognize his abuse without him having to explicitly tell people. He can‚Äôt tell people because of the shame. That‚Äôs the grip Martha has on him; she can see he was abused. Even in that intimate fantasy, she says something about him being abused.",1,99
272,I wanted to scream at him when he saw she was a jailed criminal stalker and he accepted her friend request,0,1
327,How would his actions appear ‚Äúviolent‚Äù? In any way shape of form. I‚Äôm not sure that word is appropriate here.,0,99
683,"Riveting and disturbing episode! What did he ""discover"" while showering that got him so upset?!",0,99
252,"Holy heck this is creepy. I understand there‚Äôs something else going on and I also know he feels sorry for her but so far he‚Äôs also frustrating the hell out of me. This woman needs help, not to be egged on.",1,1
282,"What was the reason he joined a trans dating website site if he wasn‚Äôt into dating trans people? I didn‚Äôt get that. I only just finished ep 2, no spoilers, please!",0,99
295,He's getting on my nerves Martha is crazy and too much. And I am so grateful for a character like Teri who is speaking sanity. Its complicated. And layered.,0,99
1023,The part in the monologue where he details how much he only loves and can love hating himself. The abuse he has suffered has warped his mind so much that he can only head towards more abuse.,1,99
861,"No, the scene is immediately preceded by him talking about him imagining Martha, then flashing to him in the same position with Teri (showing him imagining it) talking about how he could finally do it now, because of what he was imagining",0,99
1200,Same here. I bawled three times with this show. When he was speaking at the final show and with his parents.,1,99
1145,"Because he did it after reading his abuser‚Äôs notes on his script, I read it as an attempt to figure out if his abuser ever really thought he had talent or if it was all just part of the ploy. He was still seeking validation. And after he left he was frightened by how tempted he was to actually follow through on the offer to write for his show, so he turned to the voicemails from Martha to build himself up instead.",1,99
735,"Because he was being groomed. It builds layers of complexity that means things aren‚Äôt so black and white, and it‚Äôs difficult to understand that you‚Äôre being abused or mistreated.",1,0
751,Yep just did and makes so much sense now. Also can‚Äôt believe this actually happened to the actor in his real life & he is the writer and director of this show!!!,0,99
620,"I had a journey similar to his after my rapes, and I've never seen it illustrated, discussed or referenced in any way like this before. The journey, trying to make it unimportant by covering it up with other liaisons, the way you feel like it's something inside you that brought it on... It was really validating (and sad) to see someone else travelling that same road.",0,0
564,Would you say that about a woman in his situation?,99,99
1020,Why doesn‚Äôt he just changed his email and number?,0,1
1194,I don't think he will get obsessed with the bartender. It's not that literal. But yes that scene was to show the parallels,0,99
896,Wait so did he have sex with Martha? Please explain that scene to me,99,99
1149,"Maybe, but I don‚Äôt think so. Donnie said himself how much he craves fame and importance and now that Martha has gone away he needs to find his hit somewhere else",0,99
650,"Very powerful and brave to share this experience and yet, in the age of me too, why hasn't his rapist been identified? The irony that he acknowledges the perceived hypocrisy of reporting the stalker but not the rapist and then the Internet going to all lengths to identify a random, mentally ill woman, but not to identify a famous, powerful rapist is extremely upsetting.",0,99
1120,"But right back into the situation he was in when the whole thing with Martha started! I would have thought that would have been triggering in its own way, too.",0,99
662,"At first I was like, wow this guy's helping him out of kindness but after a while, well before the actual assault, my gut feeling told me something's not right.",99,99
414,He should have pushed that post-joke dance button. That would have been perfect comedic timing.,99,99
182,"Yes, but as the policeman explains to him, it's different because there is a difference in physical capabilities to do harm. Also, he isn't discouraging her or explaining to her any of her misinterpretations. He just encourages it more.",0,1
916,"He can't find arousal/no longer associates sex with a healthy relationship. The only way he can get turned on anymore is by committing acts of self desecration, and the most self destructive path for him is to fuck Martha (who is the most external representation/surrogate for his life spiralling into ruin).",0,99
1064,"Saddest moment in the show when he revealed to his parents about being raped and his sexuality -- and his dad says ""I grew up in the Catholic Church"" I LOL'd üòÇ üòÇ And we just gotta infer that he was molested based on that one line.",99,99
297,"To answer the second part, he doesn't want Teri to run into Martha there - or himself - since he said he's a construction worker. I rewatched the part where he signed up a couple times and was not sure why he lied about who he was. I thought at first he didn't want to be fished out by Martha on there, but seems like he's so insecure about himself actually that he invented a different persona.",0,99
269,"I'm only two episodes in, but I'm thinking he really is attracted to Terri, but can't get over his shame, and keeping Martha around subconsciously makes him feel more like a ""real man"" who has a woman obsessed with him. All incredibly fucked, but plausible",0,99
925,"Because the situation is deeply nuanced and messed up. In a way, he likes the thrill of this bad thing happening to him.",0,1
903,Wait but how do we know that? Why was he so nervous talking to the detective and asking ‚Äúdid she say anything? Did she pass anything on?‚Äù What was he referring to,0,99
335,I wonder if it was because she has made false accusations at other people in the past and he doesn't want to give her leverage to try to use against him.,0,99
307,It's because he is a man and the stalker is a woman. No wonder he didn't go to the cops. He thought she was mentally unwell but if Martha was a man she would just be seen as a perv. She is the female version of a nice guy. Using sympathy to get away with being horrible.,1,99
368,"Most victims of abuse have some kind of attachment to their abuser. It's often silly, irrational, or self-serving. If you ask a victim of an abusive ex why they stayed, they will tell you a vast majority of the time their mindset at the time was that they loved them or that they offered some kind of stability (a home, income, a job, etc.), or a combination of the two Maybe instead of an exciting love-life for him it was just the platonic relationship with this woman who made him feel special because she was crazy about him. She seemed to help his stand up routine by getting the audience warmed up, there are plenty of abuse victims who endured abuse because it improved their chances at stardom; victims of Harvey Weinstein and P. Diddy have similar stories although less direct. The next episode had something similar with a different abuser that was way more direct. Part of the rest of it seems to be he felt bad for her and felt scared of doing anything. The lack of sympathy from others did a lot to prevent him from doing anything. He co-workers thought she was harmless and wouldn't ban him from the bar. His exes and the police viewed it as a non-problem. He's even unsympathetic to Reddit commenters. Telling victims of abuse to *just leave* sounds easy enough but how difficult it is can be hard to understand.",1,0
210,"Saying that would hurt her though. I'm still only on episode 1, but my interpretation is that he can see she's a woman with serious mental problems, and he doesn't want to add to them by having her crush so utterly reject her. In her state she could be prone to suicide and while he doesn't want to be around her, he is not willing to be the thing that breaks her. So instead he's trying to let her down easy, remaining her friend but rebuffing any overt romantic gestures. However she constantly places him in social situations where the options are to reject her completely or become something more serious, and he keeps trying to defuse those situations with sexual jokes that just serve to encourage her further. The scene with the other bar patrons is a perfect example of this; they forced him into either accepting her as girlfriend or saying ""she's not my girlfriend, I'm just joking around"", which would absolutely devastate her psychologically, so he tried to escape with a joke that she took as a promise. Or the ""date"" they had. She wanted for them to go on a legitimate date, which he turned down. However she pushed by asking what friends do then, which again forced him into either going to get coffee together as friends, or saying ""I'm not your friend"", which once again would be emotionally devastating to her and not something that he is willing to inflict. My understanding is that he doesn't even want to be her friend at all, but how can you reject somebody who want to be your friend without being the bad guy hurting other's emotions for no reason? So he goes with her as a friend, but to her it's their first date. As somebody who hates confrontation and likes to make people happy I sympathise a lot with Gadd's character.",1,0
982,"I teared up seeing him walk forward through the audience after his monologue, instead of leaving backstage. It seemed like a very intentional, symbolic choice. He made his demons known. For the first time since this all began he had nothing left to be ashamed of. It was a powerful choice.",1,99
670,"That may be one of the best bottle episodes in a show in a very long time. Everything up until this episode you become infuriated by the lack of motivation and confidence in him that when the wrap up of this episode comes about, every question is answered and brings us into a new journey in the second half of the season. Just perfect.",0,99
790,"as much as it is an incredibly cinematic episode to watch, I wish I didnt. it was so disturbing, I also hate how normal it is for tv to show SA scenes. But I guess I was just screaming at my phone. Like ""tell him to stop!!"" ""fight! leave! dont go back"" and I dont get why he went back so many times. its so painful watching someone destroy themselves.",0,1
987,That viral video is the show we watched. He put his story in front of the whole world to see.,0,99
222,Man he is leading her on HARD it‚Äôs aggravating,0,1
569,Wow i didnt know it was really his story,99,99
1135,"Exactly. Yep, no escaping it. His groomer will always have a grip on him, no matter what.",0,99
784,"Can someone explain the joke he makes ‚Äúmy mom died today, I guess this is what she would‚Äôve wanted, me to die with her‚Äù",99,99
1136,"He did leave this time quickly, so even if they haven‚Äôt been cured I do think it also showed improvement",0,99
298,"He explains this - he is scared of being recognized by people he knows, both online and in real life, because he is ashamed of being interested in trans women. So, he uses a fake name, insists on their dates being in a part of town/at a bar where no one he knows will frequent, and invents a fake job so she won't come to his. Agreed that he also partially lies about the bar to protect her from Martha, but at first he just doesn't want his colleagues to find out he is dating a trans woman.",1,99
1176,"It‚Äôs true, unfortunately. This is must be his way of naming his tormentor.",0,99
373,Why does he stare at Teri for so long at the very end. Why does she stay on the floor for so long. I was confused about the ending scene. Does Martha know Teri is trans or is she dirty because of her race? She looks white to me so I am confused. Also why is she bald at the very end.,0,99
1167,"Funny to me, since I could relate with any self destructive behaviour as soon as I watched Ep 4. It was nearly identical how he dealt with trauma.",1,99
798,This is very different from a rape victim or groomer who was a family member/teacher. And now that I‚Äôve finished the series he acknowledges it more. He went back 4-5 times after waking up to a dick in his mouth/being assaulted because he ‚Äúhated himself.‚Äù So I was kind of right about the self sabotage/destructive behaviour he was participating in. He had low self esteem so he didn‚Äôt want to cut himself from the only source saying he was going to make it. It doesn‚Äôt make me have less sympathy for him but I don‚Äôt really classify his abuse in the same way.,1,99
676,"It‚Äôs ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù told but absolutely horrible how it comes together with how Marthas compliments and affections is the first time he feels good again‚Ä¶ damn,",1,99
205,"Oh I‚Äôm still watching! On ep 2. Just aggravating how he leads her on instead of being straight up sorry I don‚Äôt like you and I don‚Äôt want to date you, ever let‚Äôs not hang out anymore",0,1
369,It seems like a warped form of self harm at this point. He doesn't necessarily enjoy it but it makes him feel alive somehow?,1,99
719,"That was one time which brings me to my original statement, I don‚Äôt understand why he continue to go back. but after I continue to watch, I understood why he continued to go back. He was a drug addict that was seeking fame. He wasn‚Äôt drugged. He was taking drugs. Big difference.",0,99
374,"I believe that he was in shock when looking at Teri's state after Martha's assault on her. Martha doesn't know that Teri is trans, hence why she screamed ""you look like a man"". I believe that, if she knew Teri was trans she would have insulted her in a more specific way that relates to that. Apparently Teri is Mexican, so maybe that's why Martha was being so racist.",0,99
209,He is so spineless omg and the biggest liar I‚Äôve ever seen,0,1
983,"i was thinking the same. the public-ness of his monologue made me think of the phrase, shame dies in the light.",0,99
203,"My thought exactly. He should have got away after her first crazy reaction at the cafeteria, instead he gave her complete access to his past life accepting her friend request! Also why he doesn't block her email address? I don't get it...maybe he's just too good and he can't say no to people but still...",0,1
742,Yeah he did initially help him with his show a lot. Completely grooming,0,99
860,We literally have an entire scene of him running over there to Martha and fucking her. it‚Äôs not about people not being observant it just wasn‚Äôt that clear if it was real or not. Which I think was the intention of how the scene was done. It immediately flashing to him in bed with Teri it‚Äôs obvious why people would think he went back to Teri after just fucking Martha..,0,99
1104,I hated that he went back to his rapist. I hope he got therapy in real life.,1,99
787,"Well the audience needs to laugh at his intro in order for the joke to land. Like, my mom just died, audience laughs and he will say well this is not the response I expected and the audience will laugh more. Just a chain reaction. But no one laughed. So the ‚Äòdie with her‚Äô is just a cope out.",0,99
1027,Dude likes having a stalker,0,1
769,"The freak out while he was on acid got my heart beating, genuinely more horrifying than any horror or thriller film I‚Äôve watched recently. And I watch a lot. I‚Äôve had bad trips before and also experienced same sex sexual assault, I cannot imagine having realizations about being in a bad situation while incredibly fucked up. It‚Äôs fucking painful and this episode was so disturbing and uncomfortable and sad. I just wanted to cry with him and hug him. Between this and I May Destroy you, sexual assault has been put in such a raw and real, but not sexually gratuitous way, like so many shows do.",1,99
283,"He's into it, he just feels ashamed to be seen with her out of fear of being seen as emasculated or gay. I'm a trans woman and this is common with guys who are into us, they have been conditioned to feel shame for it and often want to keep it a secret.",1,99
630,Deeply upsetting episode. Poor guy. I hope the rapist gets what he deserves in real life. It‚Äôs one of the most revolting things you can do to another human being.,1,99
862,"Exactly i don‚Äôt know why they are acting as if it‚Äôs that far fetched/crazy to think the scene was real.. We literally have an entire scene of him running over to Martha and fucking her. I think the intention of the way it was done, although confusing was meant to symbolize how fucked up his mind was after everything he was been through. Lines were blurred for him",1,99
1098,"I completely agree. Parts made me literally feel sick, and I had tears streaming down my face during his entire speech.",1,99
731,My question is - why did he stay? Why couldn‚Äôt he leave even tho he had a nice girlfriend? Was it due to addiction?!?,0,99
1171,"Got me crying like a baby when he sat down with his parents to share. Wow that was cathartic. Incredible show, nothing else quite like it.",1,0
937,Him. Martha told them he was in the hospital after a car accident.,0,99
256,Yeah he definitely isn‚Äôt making things better,0,1
290,"I'm just kind of curious in the phone both scene is he doing coke or is it just a weird gesture (edit: saw the coke baggie fall into the toilet later)? Also the trans dating site you signed up on his implications supposed to be that his partner thinks he's trans? Also wondering what his date means when she says ""you're a tremendous liar""",0,99
927,I thought he actually had sex with her?,99,99
1168,"This show made me understand myself in ways no therapy was ever able to do. The last scene, I think he not only realized they were the same, but that he had become her safe place and she had become his....in the most toxic way possible. Trauma changes people and those that haven't experienced can never understand.",1,99
217,This was so painful to watch. I don't want to victim blame but this man is enabling her... She's shown time and time again how unwell she is and he's just playing along? I'm dumbfounded.,0,1
818,"I have never felt such a physical reaction to a tv show before, I wanted to throw up multiple times while watching it and I‚Äôve just been feeling so heavy and empty after finishing it. I really cannot imagine the amount of strength it takes to live through this experience, write a show about it and also enact it. All the power to him.",1,99
325,"He seriously waited so long to intervene, I was like damn dude you need to step it up like yesterday wtf.",0,1
