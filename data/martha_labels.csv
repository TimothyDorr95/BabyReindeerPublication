So raw so real it’s covered so many topics I don’t even know where to start. This hit home for me so much personally because of the grooming and abuse of power especially in the entertainment industry . The fact that the stalker wasn’t even the main plot of this story .. this is one of the best shows i’ve watched in a. long time!This is a proper limited series. The fact that it’s a real story just boggles my brain. It made me feel like i need to be in therapy for a lot of things in my life too😂😭

She had horrific abuse and the only constant was her little stuffed animal. She equated him to that toy and seeing her cry when they were taking her to jail just made me feel so incredibly sad for her and what she went through. People with complex trauma like her need intense therapy, not prison (which often just exacerbates their symptoms).
